Our Primary 6 pupils participate in community outreach programme at two primary schools and two orphanages, the pupils learnt to:

i)    have a deep desire to serve others

ii)   show empathy and care towards others

iii)   build community through the VIA Programme.

Prior to the VIA, pupils planned and prepared for activities that they would carry out at the Indonesian schools. During camp preparation day, pupils got into the camp groups to learn balloon sculpting, plan lesson plans for micro-teaching and games for friendly matches and prepare materials for setting up the reading corner. They also helped to pack donated items into duffel bags to be given to the Indonesian pupils.

Pupils found the VIA activities meaningful as every child had the experience in bringing joy to and interacting with the local pupils. Such values in action have indeed come alive as pupils were being immersed in a setting that promotes compassion, care, friendship and volunteerism.
