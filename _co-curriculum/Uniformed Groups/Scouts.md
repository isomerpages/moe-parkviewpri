<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Park View Primary School Scout Unit started in 2011.&nbsp; We strive to
develop our cub scouts so that they are ready and prepared to experience
an interesting adventure that places a strong emphasis on contributing
to society.&nbsp; Our cub scouts work in a patrol system where the values
of teamwork, trust and loyalty will always be honed. Outdoor Scouting,
Sports and Hobbies, Science and Nature, Creativity, Knowing Your Community
and Country, Taking Care of Oneself and Helping Others, and many other
activities are all part of Cub Scouting.&nbsp; The commemoration of our
Founderâ€™s Day and the Diamond Jubilee Challenge Fund Raising are the two
major activities for 2022.&nbsp; Outdoor activities will resume once the
MOE and SSA have given the approval.&nbsp; Cub Scouts will be guided through
the process of completing their Scout Proficiency Book and earning Proficiency
Badges.</p>
