<h4>PLAY@PARKVIEW OVERVIEW</h4>
<p><strong>Play@ParkView</strong> is Park View Primary's unique and exciting
implementation of the Programme for Active Learning, or PAL. PAL is an
initiative by the Ministry of Education to realise a more balanced curriculum
and facilitate the well-rounded development of students. PAL provides children
with opportunities for exposure to a broad range of activities so that
they can discover their aptitudes and interests.</p>
<p><strong>Play@ParkView</strong> is a non-academic programme built into the
curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students. Students will get to participate
in the three domains: Visual Arts, Creative Movements, Sports &amp; Games
and Outdoor Education. Play @ Park View is designed in the form of fun
modular learning activities where students will develop confidence and
creativity, and be encouraged to explore and extend lessons learnt to their
daily lives.</p>
<h4>The ‘Experience-Express-Reflect' Lesson Model</h4>

<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Park%20View%20Experience/The%20‘Experience-Express-Reflect'%20Lesson%20Model_1.png">
</div>
<p>In order to provide a holistic PAL visual art education, the lessons are
crafted based on the three pillars.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Express</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Students will experience ‘hands-on’ activities through discovery and active
participation using the ‘EER’ learning model. With the ‘hands-on’ experiences,
students are given opportunities and avenues to express their thoughts
and creative ideas. Students are encouraged to believe in their own ideas,
to be confident and to be imaginative through looking at things from different
perspectives. Most importantly, time is set aside for students to share
about their learning experiences. As they do so, they will discover more
about themselves. They will also learn to better interact with their peers
and develop their social and emotional skills.</p>

<h3>Visual Arts Module</h3>
<p>Visual arts is one of the 3 domains of PAL and it focuses on ‘Doodling’.
The aim is to provide students with the opportunity to experience the creativity
and imagination involved in the world of cartooning and doodling. Through
this module, students have the chance to discover their aptitude and interests,
develop their confidence and creativity and hone their drawing and colouring
skills through fun learning activities. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)
is also incorporated in every PAL lesson to promote positive social and
emotional development in the students.</p>
<h4>Primary 1</h4>
<p><strong>Animal Kingdom</strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary 1 students will be introduced to the basics of doodling and
squiggling and the different types of lines, shapes and patterns. They
will learn the correct techniques of colouring and colour blends. In addition,
students will squiggle, doodle and have fun learning about animals and
their characteristics. They will also work as a team to freely expressed
and create animal doodles based on a squiggle.</p>

<h5><u>Gallery E-Book</u></h5>
<p>The objective of the eBook project was to showcase pupils’ group work
digitally. The eBook project captured the creative abilities and imagination
of our pupils. Pupils were challenged to create scenes (story segment)
from 7 fairy tales. Each fairy tale is broken into 6 scenes and pupils
worked closely in groups of 5 to express their ideas based on the fairy
tale that the group had been assigned.</p>
<p>The pupils had read the story before generating ideas for the illustrations.
Two P2 pupils were selected to record the eBook stories on 20/4/2010. The
completed works were uploaded into an eBook using the Koolbits software
As part of the school’s efforts to nurture talents, 13 pupil talents were
identified to work with the trainers on 04/5/2010 to recreate a set of
illustrations for the book “Little Red Riding Hood”. They were challenged
to illustrate the story scenes based on random squiggles drawn by the trainers.
Their creative works were shared with the teachers and the pupils. The
eBook is also used as a resource for the school’s reading programme, which
caters to weak readers in the lower primary Since 2010, we have moved on
and created many interesting eBook stories with our pupils based on different
SEL values. Please find out more from our Visual Arts Modules.</p>

<h3>Outdoor Education Module</h3>
<p>In this module, students learn to observe how plants grow and develop
a lively curiosity about how nature brings colour and variety to the environment.
Basic outdoor skills are also being developed, like preparing for outdoor
trips and how to deal with creatures and plants in our environment. They
are taken on outdoor trips which are slightly different from the usual
learning journeys. These learning activities are designed to challenge
students to move out of their comfort zone to the natural environment to
enable the appreciation and love for nature. At the end of every lesson,
time will be set aside for the students to express and reflect on their
learning experiences.</p>
