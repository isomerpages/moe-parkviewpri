It is also a ceremony to recognise and appreciate the contributions of all SLC student leaders. Each SLC will be led by the respective Key Leaders who will share about the cause championed by each SLC. HAF certificates will then be presented to the SLC student leaders to recognise their contributions to the school for the year. This is followed with a march in by all the student leaders. The Key Leaders will then lead the student leaders in pledging their commitment and service through a pledge.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SLC_Prefects.jpg"></div><h4>Prefectorial Board</h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Prefects.jpg"></div><p>The Prefectorial Board comprises pupil leaders selected for their exemplary conduct and leadership qualities.
