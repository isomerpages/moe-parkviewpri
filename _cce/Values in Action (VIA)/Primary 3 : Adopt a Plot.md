# **Primary 3 : Adopt-a-Plot**

Our P3 pupils participate in a Value in Action Project in Term 1 and 2. The project, called Adopt-a-Plot, provides opportunities for pupils to take care of a plot of garden by themselves. Their responsibilities include watering the plants, ensuring the plot is clean by picking up litters and checking of any dangerous things that can harm the plants and pupils.

This project aims to:

1.  Develop and instil a sense of care and respect for the environment through caring for the plants in school
2.  Promote social awareness and relationship building competencies, and character among pupils

The Adopt-a-Plot taps on pupils’ knowledge about plants, which were taught in the P3 Science syllabus, enhances pupils’ people skills in terms of teamwork and is aligned to the school’s Shared Values.

The diagram below shows what the pupils go through for their P3 VIA Adopt-a-Plot.
