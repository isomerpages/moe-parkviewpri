<p><em>Warm Greetings from Park View Primary School and welcome to 2025!</em>
</p>
<p>We trust you have enjoyed a relaxing year-end break with your children.
As we reflect on the memorable year of 2024, we take pride in celebrating
the varied achievements and progress of our students throughout the year.
From our P1s successfully completing their first year in school to our
capable P6s graduating after tackling their PSLE, it's inspiring to witness
the unique journey each student has embarked on. A special congratulations
to the class of 2024 for their outstanding effort in the PSLE; we are delighted
to announce that 100% of our students are eligible for Secondary School.
Our students' accomplishments are a testament to their perseverance, dedication,
and the unwavering support of our exceptional teachers and parents who
have been pivotal in their academic journey. Our P2s to P5s have also reached
new milestones in their Primary School journey, with some moving to new
classes, taking on different subjects, and forging new friendships. It
has indeed been an exhilarating year for the Park View family. As we bid
farewell to the class of 2024, we extend a warm welcome to the newest members
of the Park View family—the Primary 1 students of 2025. Embarking on a
new chapter can be both exciting and daunting, but we are confident that,
like their predecessors, they will find PVPS a welcoming and dynamic place
to call home. Looking forward to an exciting and vibrant 2025, let's renew
our commitment to working together to nurture our students into leaders
of character. Our dedication to holistic development remains steadfast,
and we are excited to continue offering a vibrant array of activities as
part of the Park View Experience. These bespoke programs are designed to
foster the growth of our students, boosting their confidence and shaping
them into empowered, self-directed leaders. From innovative academic initiatives
to enriching extracurricular activities, the Park View Experience is set
to provide a comprehensive and enriching educational journey. As our vision
states, we hope that all our Park View students will grow into “Leaders
of Character, championing Service and Excellence”! We extend our deepest
gratitude to the parents for your continuous support, which has been instrumental
in the success of our students. Your partnership is invaluable, and we
look forward to your ongoing support in the years ahead. May the year 2025
bring joy, prosperity, and new milestones for all. Stay healthy, and on
behalf of the entire Park View Primary School community, we wish you a
Happy New Year 2025!</p>
