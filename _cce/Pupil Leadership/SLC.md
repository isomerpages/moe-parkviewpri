### SLC Pledge

We, the Service Learning Council leaders of Park View Primary School,

pledge ourselves as confident leaders who are role models,

to show respect for our teachers and friends,

uphold integrity, be fair and just,

work in synergy with one another towards our common goals,

have courage to face challenges and 

commit ourselves to excellence in everything we do

in upholding the rules and values of the school.

### Investiture

The school holds its Service Learning Council (SLC) Investiture yearly to emplace SLC student leaders as well as Key Leaders into their roles and positions in this ceremony. It is also a ceremony to recognise and appreciate the contributions of all SLC student leaders. Each SLC will be led by the respective Key Leaders who will share about the cause championed by each SLC. HAF certificates will then be presented to the SLC student leaders to recognise their contributions to the school for the year. This is followed with a march in by all the student leaders. The Key Leaders will then lead the student leaders in pledging their commitment and service through a pledge.
