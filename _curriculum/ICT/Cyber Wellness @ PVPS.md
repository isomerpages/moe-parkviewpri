<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness @ PVPS</strong></h4>
<p><strong>What is Cyber Wellness?</strong>
</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It
involves an understanding of the risks of harmful online behaviors, an
awareness of how to protect oneself and other Internet users from such
behaviors.</p>

<p>PVPS adapts MOE’s Sense-Think-Act framework to develop pupils’ instinct
to protect and empower them to take responsibility for their well-being
in cyberspace. The two principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’ and ‘Safe
and Responsible Use’ when adhered to will anchor pupils’ well-being in
cyberspace as they will then be able to make careful and well-considered
decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Sense:</strong> Pupils should be able to identify the possible
risks.
<br><strong>Think:</strong> Pupils should be able to analyse, evaluate and
reflect on the online situation they are facing based on the two principles.
<br><strong>Act:</strong> Pupils should be able to translate his/her understanding
into actions that will keep him/her safe while online.</p>
<p>The Cyber Wellness Curriculum focusses on the development of 21st century
and social-emotional competencies in the use of ICT. The main platform
for the delivery of the lessons is via Form Teacher Guidance Periods (in
Primary schools).</p>
<p>PVPS also collaborates with FamilyMatters@School to engage TOUCH Cyber
Wellness to train and empower our Service Learning Council (SLC) Cyber
Wellness Ambassadors to have greater sense of responsibility, perseverance,
optimism, better self-esteem and confidence. The Ambassadors will also
able to identify potential hazards in the cyberspace faced by their peers
and provide solution to address these concerns. Assembly talks are conducted
by our SLC Cyber Wellness Ambassadors to promote good cyber wellness practices.</p>
