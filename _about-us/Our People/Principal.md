<center><i>Warm Greetings from Park View Primary School and welcome to 2024!</i> <center>

<p align="justify">From all of us here at Park View Primary School, we hope you have had a restful December break with your children.
	
</p><p align="justify">Reflecting on the past year, 2023 was indeed a memorable chapter for Park View as we celebrated the diverse achievements and progress of our students. From the P1s completing their inaugural year in school to our accomplished P6s successfully graduating after conquering their PSLE, it's heartening to witness the remarkable journey each student undertakes. A special congratulations to the class of 2023 for giving their best in the PSLE; we are thrilled to share that 100% of our students are eligible for Secondary School. Our students' success is a testament to their hard work, dedication, and the unwavering support of our incredible teachers and parents who have played an integral role in their academic journey.

</p><p align="justify"> As we bid farewell to the class of 2023, we extend a warm welcome to the newest members of the Park View familyâ€”the Primary 1 students of 2024. Embarking on a new chapter can be both exciting and nerve-wracking, but we are confident that, like their predecessors, they will find PVPS a warm and vibrant place to call home.

</p><p align="justify">Entering the promising year of 2024, let's renew our commitment to working together to nurture our students to be leaders of character. Our dedication to holistic development remains unwavering, and we are thrilled to continue with a vibrant suite of activities as part of the Park View Experience. These tailored programs are designed to foster the growth of our students, building their confidence and nurturing them into empowered, self-directed leaders. From innovative academic initiatives to enriching extracurricular activities, the Park View Experience is poised to provide a comprehensive and enriching educational journey.

</p><p align="justify">We express our heartfelt gratitude to the parents for your continuous support, which has been instrumental in the success of our students. Your partnership is invaluable, and we look forward to your continued support in the years to come.

</p><p align="justify">May the year 2024 bring joy, prosperity, and new milestones for all. Stay healthy, and on behalf of the entire Park View Primary School community, we wish you a Happy New Year 2024!
