<center><i>Warmest Greetings to all and welcome to Park View Primary School!</i> <center>

<p>2022 was an exciting year as we celebrated the school’s 25th Anniversary with the theme of “Remembering, Rejoicing & Reimagining”. We rejoiced by celebrating the achievements of our students across various areas and together with the resumption of many school-wide events, our students were given the opportunities to participate in many exciting activities. These programmes and events have allowed our students to go through the unique Park View experience that we have sought out to provide for each and every Park View student throughout their time here. <p>

<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to once again, congratulate the class of 2022 for having done their best for their PSLE in 2022. Our students have done well across all areas and we wish them all the best as they embark on a new milestone of their life in Secondary School. A big Thank You goes out as well to our teachers and parents who have walked this journey with them.

<p>As our class of 2022 moves on, we welcome our new members of the Park View family; the Primary 1 students of 2023. They will also be starting a new journey and I believe I speak on behalf of the rest of the PVPS family when I say that we are excited to meet each and every one of the new members to the family. We hope that, just like the seniors, they will find PVPS a warm and vibrant place to call home. And to our P2s to P6s, we are happy to have you back for an exciting year ahead!

<p>As we continue with the theme of our 25th Anniversary, let us continue to help our students to reimagine the future. As we move into the next phase of Park View’s journey, we hope that our students continue to leave a positive mark and influence on the community as they shape their own lives and those around them. We hope that in 2023, our students will continue to reimagine all the possibilities that they can achieve and strive to be Leaders of Character, Championing Service and Excellence,

<p>To all our stakeholders, we look forward to our continued partnership for 2023. We would not have been able to come so far without the support of each and every one of you. On behalf of the PVPS family, I would also like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a Happy and Healthy 2023. Do continue to keep well and stay safe!
