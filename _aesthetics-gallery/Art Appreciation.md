# **Art Appreciation**

### Art Outreach

**Community Outreach Programme through Recycled Art**

Art Club members, in collaboration with the Green Ambassadors, carry out the yearly Community Outreach Programme through Recycled Art by reaching out to the kindergarten pupils to share with them the importance of environment conservation and how they can do their part to protect mother Earth.

Through simple craftwork, the Art Club members teach the kindergarten pupils how to transform common household trash such as toilet rolls, bottle caps and plastic bottles into useful craftwork such as pencil holders and coin banks.

This programme is also a platform to develop the social and emotional competencies of our pupils and an opportunity for them to hone their leadership skills.
