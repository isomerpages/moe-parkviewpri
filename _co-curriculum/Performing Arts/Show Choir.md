# **Show Choir**

Show Choir combines choral singing with dance movements, occasionally within the context of a specific idea or story. Our PVPS Choir began in January 2011 as a traditional choir ensemble. Over the years, under the guidance of instructors from John & Deniece Glee Studio LLP, it has evolved into a Show Choir where elements such as voice training, singing techniques, dance moves as well as stage etiquette are incorporated. In PVPS Show Choir, members are nurtured into confident and resilient individuals. They will be given opportunities to perform for special school events as well as events held by external organisations.
