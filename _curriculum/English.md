### English Department Framework

![](/images/FRAMEWORK.jpg)

We would like to our students to be passionate learners who are proficient in the English Language.

To achieve this, the department embarks on the following key approaches:

1.  Provide a strong foundation for all
2.  Cultivate the love for reading and literature
3.  Develop the critical life skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing through differentiated and engaging strategies

<h3><a name="Curriculum"></a>Curriculum</h3>

#### Primary 1 and 2


**STELLAR**

STELLAR stands for “Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading”. Instead of using traditional textbooks and workbooks, the STELLAR programme emphasises foundational skills in grammar and vocabulary and enriches students’ learning through the use of stories and texts that engage and stretch their imagination.

Through the reading of engaging stories in class, students get to speak extensively, discussing and sharing their views with the teacher and their peers. This builds students’ confidence in speech and writing, and enhance their learning of the language.

The lower primary strategies include Shared Book Approach (SBA), Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) and Learning Centres (LC).

**Shared Book Approach (SBA)**

In SBA, the teacher first introduces and shares a Big Book with the pupils. Then, the teacher teaches language items, structures and skills explicitly, which includes concepts of print, phonics and grammar.

After which, teachers will select a range of follow-up activities such as drama or art and craft according to their pupils’ learning needs.


**Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)**

In MLEA, there is a shared experience that is linked to the Big Book that has been read during Shared Reading. This shared experience provides the context and content for the students to think and talk about, using the language structures and vocabulary they have been exposed to in SBA.

The students will come up with a piece of class writing in which the teacher transcribes the students’ inputs. This will then become the basis for group writing, when the children work in small groups, before they go on to individual writing.

Through MLEA, pupils also learn about cooperative learning as they work together in mixed-ability groups.

**Learning Centres (LC)**

In the learning centres, the language skills learnt in both SBA and MLEA are reinforced. There are usually three main learning centres – the Reading Centre, the Word Study Centre and the Listening Centre. Students have the opportunity to re-learn, revisit or extend what they have learnt at their own pace and in differentiated ability groups.

#### Primary 3 and 4

**STELLAR**

At P3 and P4, students will be able to consolidate and extend skills already learned in P1 and P2 as well as acquire new skills and knowledge about how language works. There will still be opportunities for cooperative learning but more emphasis will be placed on independence in listening, reading and viewing as well as speaking, presenting and writing.

The strategies at P3 and P4 include Support Reading (SR),

Know - Want to know – Learnt (KWL), Retelling (RT), Language Activities and Sentence Manipulation and Writing Process Cycle (WPC).


**Supported Reading (SR)**

In Supported Reading, students make predictions, read assigned sections of the text silently, discuss the text and difficult words as a whole class, led by the teacher. This strategy is usually carried out for narrative and information texts.

**Know - Want to know - Learnt (KWL)**

KWL helps students to extract information and relate it to what they already know about the topic. Teachers guide students to organise, access and remember information. This will enable pupils to understand and follow the logic of information presented in a text, recognise information that is repeated and distinguish between main ideas and details. As the students learn to be more independent in extracting information from what they read, the teacher’s support is gradually reduced. KWL is used mainly for non-fiction texts such as information reports.

**Writing Process Cycle (WPC)**
C provides pupils with guidance in the processes of planning, writing and reviewing before they apply these skills in writing independently. The focus is more on the creative aspects of writing.

#### Primary 5 and 6

**STELLAR**

**Retelling (RT)**

Retelling is a reading comprehension strategy that engages students at different levels of language: from interpreting meaning at the whole text level, to individual words and phrases and back to the whole text again. It provides opportunities for pupils to engage in a whole range of important language and cognitive processes including recall of events/information, main points and characters, text structures and language features. It also provides opportunities for all of the major language skills to be applied - listening, reading and viewing as well as speaking, presenting and writing - as pupils actively make meaning of texts and share their understanding with their peers.

**Language Activities and Sentence Manipulation**

Oral and written activities will provide students with explicit instruction in oracy, word study, genre, grammar and language use at the various levels of language (word part, word, phrase, sentence, text, inter-textual).


**Writing**

At the upper levels, the focus is on writing. Teachers aim to teach students skills in developing their plots and actions as well as to use more descriptive phrases in writing their stories.

A writing handbook was developed by the EL department which pupils use for reference. For each writing lesson, pupils use a mindmap which incorporates the Six Thinking Hats to plan their stories.


**Oral Communication Skills (OCS)**

The department has also developed an OCS package which provides a structured approach for students to tackle the two components in the PSLE oral examination. The package highlights the guidelines to take note of and the techniques for the two components. For the component on Stimulus-based Conversation, pupils were taught how to use the DEW (provide Details, Elaborate and explain Why) strategy to discuss a given picture. Students were further taught how to describe each focal point using the TREES (Thoughts, Reasons, Examples, Experiences, Suggestion) strategy.

### Speech & Drama (Primary 1 and 2)

As part of the school’s holistic approach to give our students a well-rounded education, all Primary One and Two students go through a 24-hour Speech and Drama Enrichment Programme. This programme is conducted once a week on Fridays.

Drama provides an atmosphere that allows the students to express themselves freely and without fear of criticism. In this programme, students’ speaking and listening skills are developed through a range of activities that emphasises spoken word texts, effective communication, voice projection and dramatisation.


**Objectives:**

*   To stimulate students’ imagination and creativity

*   To promote the growth and development of oral skills

*   To develop students’ skills and confidence in acting, speaking and listening

To showcase their talents, the students put up a show at our annual Little Stars and Broadway performance days. Parents are also invited to watch the show.

### Literature Appreciation (Primary 3, 4 & 5)

To cultivate the love for reading, the Literature Appreciation Enrichment Programme is conducted for all Primary 3 to Primary 5 students. In this programme, the students learn to appreciate literature and are engaged in a series of dynamic dramatic activities. These activities will involve pupils in imaginary, unscripted and spontaneous scenes framed by curricular topics, selected objectives, themes and pupils’ personal experiences.


This year, the students study the following books:

*   Primary 3 - James and the Giant Peach

*   Primary 4 - Frindle

*   Primary 5 - Around the World in 80 Days

For Primary 4, the programme ties in with SCAMPER COMES ALIVE. Students will also be given opportunities to showcase their learning through assembly programmes and Library Fiesta activities.

  

**Objectives:**

*   To develop in our pupils an appreciation for literature in an active, fun and stimulating way through the of a literature text

*   To explore characterization, themes and other key concepts in the text using drama conventions like hot-seating, forum theatre, tableaux, thought- tracking, etc

*   To challenge students to become innovative and critical thinkers who have a mature understanding of themselves as well as a strong social awareness and aesthetic appreciation.

#### EL Talent Identification

**Debate Programme**

**A brief history of our debate programme**

The debate programme in PVPS started in 2010, focusing on building the oral competencies of verbally talented pupils. It was also the year that the first PVPS debate team entered the National Wits & Words Championship, organised by the Gifted Branch (MOE). The debaters worked hard and committed many hours of intensive trainings. Despite being a novice in the debating arena, we were successful in winning the Preliminary rounds of the competition. We triumphed against all the schools and our debater even won the Good Speaker Award. For their gargantuan feat, our debate team received the Commendation Award.

Since that year, PVPS has been inducting a "debating culture” in our school. Since then, we have not looked back and been building a strong group of debaters in our school to put PVPS on the map.

**Drama Programme**

**Trinity-Guildhall in Speech & Drama**

As part of our Talent Identification programme, we aim to recognise and develop our students to their fullest potential in the area of drama. Selected students are given an opportunity to take up the Trinity-Guildhall Speech & Drama programme and examination, specially catered for students who show talents in this area. Studetns selected will go through a drama skills training and confidence development to grow their talents further.

The **Intensive Training Course for Trinity Guildhall Speech and Drama Examination** will train students and equip them with the necessary skills needed to sit for the Trinity Guildhall Speech and Drama Examination. Students will present in front of examiners from the United Kingdom and will be issued with an examination report. Successful students will receive an internationally recognised certificate from Trinity Guildhall.

The training programme assists students in the selection of performance pieces to be used in the actual examination. The trainers guide the students in a thorough understanding of their selected pieces. The course will involve intensive verse and prose presentation practices that will allow students to master speech skills, such as intonation, inflection and rhythm patterns.

Through this programme, students will:

*   develop confidence by gaining exposure to an internationally recognised examination

*   build on their potential in Speech and Drama and bring it to another level of skills development

*   further develop their love for literature and passion for drama.

### Debate

![](/images/Debate%202016.png)

Wits and Words - the national primary school debating championship, is jointly organised by MOE and the Debate Association (Singapore). Park View Primary School has been participating in this competition since 2011. Our school debaters went through a series of debating programme that focuses on building the oral competencies as well as developing confidence and persuasive skills in oral communication. Our pupils have definitely gained a wealth of experience in debating and developed confidence in their oral communication. PVPS will continue to nurture and develop the debating culture in the school.

### Journalism for Kids

An enrichment programme on journalism was conducted for selected P5 students as part of their post-examination activities . This programme was aimed at introducing students to the basics of journalism, focusing on honing pupils’ expository writing skills, specifically for newspaper report writing. It gave students a better understanding of how a newspaper report is conceptualised, written and put together.

In this programme, students learnt ho w to:

*   identify the important parts of a newspaper story;
*   learn new vocabulary and ‘sniff out’ interesting stories;
*   write catchy headlines and story leads;
*   write, edit and revise news stories; and
*   add info-graphics and photos with succinct captions.

ICT was also be integrated in this programme as pupils accessed the computers to type their individual news articles as well as work together to form their team newspapers.

Here are samples of the students' work;
