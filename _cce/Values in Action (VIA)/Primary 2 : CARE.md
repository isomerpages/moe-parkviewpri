CARE approach was deployed for the P2 VIA to achieve the following objectives:

*   To nurture our pupils to become a morally upright, responsible and gracious citizens
*   To develop and instill a sense of care and respect for their family
*   To know ways to care for their family
*   To know ways to contribute to their family

From 2015, all P2 pupils were taught the CARE approach to apply their values at home as part of their journey in becoming supportive family members who play a part in strengthening family ties. CARE stands for Contribute, Appreciate, Respect and Engage.

As pre-VIA, pupils were equipped with Life Skills @ Home during orientation programme where they learnt ways to do housework (e.g.: sweep the floor, wash the dishes, fold the towel, wipe the table and prepare sandwiches). Pupils were encourage to contribute to their family by doing some of the housework to show care and responsibility. Pupils were taught different ways to show their appreciation, how to respect their family and also how to be engaged family members.

One of the highlight of the VIA was the cookies baking session during the Budding Chef Programme where pupils baked cookies and packed them nicely to be shared with their family members at home. They were taught how to serve the cookies to their family members with respect, sincerity and joy. Pupils also helped out at home in terms of household chores, preparing food and even washing the dishes after meals.

Through the VIA activities, pupils had a better understanding of their family members and how they could contribute to their family despite their young age. They also developed more respect for others, care and concern and resilience.
