# **Creepy Crawlies**

Art club members explored ways in making use of recycled materials to create the artworks in their effort to play a more active role in conserving the limited resources and protecting the environment. Cardboard egg cartons were transformed into creepy crawlies such as caterpillars, spiders and lady bugs through the pupilsâ€™ creative minds and hands.
