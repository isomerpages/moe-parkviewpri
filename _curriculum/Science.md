<h4>Approaches</h4>
<p>The Science Department programmes are planned using a 3-pronged approach
of ‘Supporting’, ‘Enriching’ and ‘Stretching’ each student in the journey
of learning Science. Under each approach, customised programmes are planned,
implemented and reviewed to ensure its effectiveness and relevance for
different profile of students.</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>
<p><strong>Science Wall</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Science wall reflects how the three main human systems in our body,
Digestive System, Circulatory System and Respiratory System, work together
to ensure our body can function properly with the help of energy. There
is a detailed explanation with key concepts of how each human system works.
The extensive graphics also provide better understanding of the concepts
for visual learners. Each human system is also accompanied by an interactive
activity.</p>

<h4>Science Garden</h4>
<p>For students to have meaningful learning in science, it is important that
they be allowed to experience the process of seeking answers to problems.
This requires students to physically explore and discover knowledge, be
it within their environment or in a laboratory. Besides having two indoor
science laboratories, the Science Department has recently created an integrated
learning trail weaving through the open spaces in the school.</p>
<p>There are different thematic gardens simulating various natural environments.</p>
<p><strong>Blooms@Energy Hub</strong>&nbsp;is a floral garden characterized
by an explosion of colours and fragrances. It comprises a flowering and
butterfly garden.</p>
<p><strong>Food@ Energy Hub</strong> has a herbs and spices garden and a mini
vegetable plot with local fruit trees planted around the school.</p>
<p><strong>Desert@Energy Hub</strong>&nbsp;located at the back of the school
building houses desert flora with a variety of cactus.</p>
<p><strong>Rainforest@Energy Hub</strong>&nbsp;showcases a slice of a tropical
rainforest complete with a fernery garden and an eco-pond surrounded by
lush tropical vegetation. A leaf litter habitat is also set up in the fernery
garden for students to have first-hand experience in studying the conditions
of a leaf litter habitat.</p>
<p><strong>The Energy Pavilion</strong>&nbsp;is an outdoor classroom amid
the shrubs and creepers. It is a place where teachers can carry out their
lessons or briefing before adjourning to the gardens for practical sessions.</p>
<p>With the launch of the different “Hubs”, students can now just make a
short trip down to see the plants that they study about in their books.
This hands-on experience allows them to understand their lessons better.
It is always good to be near Mother Nature.</p>

<h4>Learning Journey to Singapore Science Centre</h4>
<p>P1 to P5 students will go on a learning journey to the Singapore Science
Centre every year to attend practical laboratory session or lecture demonstration
on the topics that they learn in their primary science education. The Science
Centre enrichment programmes complement the school science curriculum with
hands-on and inspiring learning experiences. The enrichment programmes
aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>provide students with experiences which build on their interest in and
stimulate their curiosity about their environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide engaging and meaningful acquisition of scientific knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry through the application of
different process skills such as observing, comparing, classifying, analysing,
inferring, evaluating and investigating.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>P6: Ecology Learning Journey &amp; Coastal Cleanup</h4>
<p>P6 students will go on an Ecology Learning Journey to Pasir Ris Beach.
The students will also get to experience a coastal clean-up at the beach
after exploring the mudflat and mangrove swamp.</p>
<p>The objectives of the learning journey are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Increase students’ awareness of the ecosystem of the seashore community
in Singapore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn about the diversity of life on the seashore and selected animals
and plants’ adaptations to life on the seashore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relate and extend students’ Science knowledge to real life experiences
so as to provide them with a deeper understanding about life around them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate a meaningful Community Involvement Project (CIP) where students
take meaningful actions to protect the environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>P6: P4 &amp; P5 Science Olympiad Training</h4>
<p>P4 and P5 students are selected to participate in Science Olympiad training.</p>
<p>The objectives of the programme are as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop students' interest, creativity, analytical thinking skill,
spirit of learning through discovery and challenge in Science</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To expose students’ with secondary science syllabus in attempt to broaden
their knowledge of Science</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prepare selected students for Primary Science Olympiad competitions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The training sessions are based on the broad science themes in the elementary
science curriculum. These lessons focused on introducing Physics, Chemistry
and Biology to students as well as to enhance their general knowledge.</p>
<p>Selected P5 students may have the opportunity to participate in the Raffles
Science Olympiad Competition (RSO) or the NUS High Singapore Primary Science
Olympiad (SPSO).</p>

<h4>P6 DNA Science Enrichment Programme</h4>
<p>In this programme, selected P6 studdents are provided the opportunity
to conduct simulated forensic investigation activities where DNA is analysed
as evidence. Through such hands-on activities, students get to extend the
learning of scientific investigation skills outside classroom setting for
scientific inquiry. In doing so, it is hoped that they are able to relate
their Science knowledge to real life experiences so as to provide them
with a deeper understanding about life around them.</p>
<p>The objectives of the programme are as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Introduction to laboratory techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction to chromatography to separate components in an ink mixture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using of apparatus in the extraction of solutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyse blood stains &amp; understand how blood stains are used to solve
mystery.</p>

<h4>P3 Budding Scientists Programme</h4>
<p>The Budding Scientists Programme is a new enrichment programme planned
for our P3 students. With the main aim of enabling our beginning Science
learners to transit seamlessly into their journey of learning Science,
the Department members came together to pool our experiences and resources
into planning an in-house enrichment programme for our young charges.</p>
<p>The objectives of the programme are as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop students’ interest and creativity, through discovery and hands-on
experiments in Science;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To learn through inquiry to clarify misconceptions in Science;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To broaden their knowledge of Science and create awareness of the natural
phenomenon in the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our P3s were highly enthused and thoroughly enjoyed the activities planned
for them. From the enriching experience, they can have a better grasp of
how Scientists conduct experiments, as they learnt how to go about designing
and conducting a fair experiment.</p>

<h4>Environment Care in PVPS</h4>
<p>Park View wants to instill a strong sense of environmental conservation
and promote environmental awareness. The school provides opportunities
to staff and students to apply knowledge, skills and values of care to
protect and improve the environment.</p>
<p>The school adopts the following <strong>5Is Approach</strong> to fulfil
our Sustainability and Environment Commitment:</p>

<h4>Recycling Corners</h4>
<p>To inculcate the culture of recycling in every student and staff, the
school has set up various recycling points to make recycling a stone’s
throw away. We have the recycling bins at the Recycling Corner for the
different recyclables, reusable cartons in classrooms for paper, carton
boxes in the staffroom, staff lounge and photocopying room for paper. A
recycling corner was set up in the canteen and also behind the flagpole
to encourage students to recycle paper and plastic bottles.</p>
