# **Holistic Awards Framework (HAF)**

To further enhance the importance of a holistic education for our pupils, the school has adopted a whole-school approach in recognising pupils for their efforts, contributions and achievements in the in the five domains namely the Cognitive, Aesthetics, Physical, Social & Moral and Leadership through the Holistic Awards Framework (HAF). The HAF certificates are presented to pupils by the School Leaders or teachers during assembly upon the completion of events. Pupils are strongly encouraged to file the certificates well as they can be useful for direct admission to secondary schools and beyond.
