<h4>Exposure</h4>
<style type="text/css">
	p {font-size:18px;font-family: arial, sans-serif;text-align: justify;}
</style>

<b>To foster greater appreciation for the arts, students are introduced to different forms of arts through programmes like assembly performances and talks.</b>
	
<p>How would it be like to encounter art on a truck? Follow Thumbs Up to visit the Roving Art Truck parked at Park View Primary!</p>

<p>A colourful art truck has arrived at Park View Primary. Packed within the truck is an exhibition of 10 paintings by local and South East Asia artists, and students are able to see them all at one go. </p>
	
<p>9 year old Devi Sravanthi is one of the first few to step foot on the Roving Art Truck. She heard about the truck previously and was eagerly waiting for it to arrive in school. When the truck came, she rushed to visit the exhibition during her recess time. </p>
	
<p>Sravanthi’s ambition was to become an artist when she grows up. She said, “I have never visited the National Gallery and have only seen art exhibitions on videos. The experience of listening to the commentator explaining about the stories behind every artwork, is a very enriching one.”</p>
	
<p>10 years old Jaylen Wong Yi Cong has the opportunity to visit the museum once every year. Earlier this year, he has also participated in the virtual tour organised by the National Gallery, hence he is able to identify many of the artworks on the Roving Art Truck.</p>
	
<p>He said, “The experience of seeing an artwork virtually and seeing it in real is very different. The gallery is a very quiet space and that creates an experience. Also, the artworks in reality are actually very huge and majestic.”</p>
	
<p>Other than paintings, there is an art wall for students to express themselves and leave comments and thoughts after their visit. The art wall will be left behind for the school when the truck leaves for another destination.</p>
	
<p>Head of Aesthetics Miss Lim Hwee Tin felt that this exposure is just the tip of an iceberg and she hopes this experience would spark the interest in art for students and open the doors to more art activities.</p>

<h4><u>Projects</u></h4>
<b>In Partnership with Arts Education Branch (AEB): SLS Art Resources for Primary Schools</b>

<p>As part of the ministry’s effort to transform learning experiences of students through purposeful use of technology, and in providing for students with greater access to arts learning, the Arts Education Branch (AEB) has been developing student learning resources that are made available for schools on Student Learning Space (SLS).   AEB collaborated with Park View Primary School to develop the Student Artist Talk Video Series, which featured two Primary 6 students, Leila Koh (6D), and Tan Yan Yi (6B), who shared their artistic processes behind the artwork created for the Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition. The artwork, entitled “Waves of Life”, received the Certificate of Recognition (Special Mention). Leila and Yan Yi also shared the art concepts through discussing about and reflecting on the artwork.</p>
