<p>Pupils of primary school going age are still at a growing age and it is
important that they do not carry excessive loads that may cause them harm
or injury. The following are our school’s guidelines to help you to&nbsp;<strong>PACK</strong>&nbsp;right
every day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P</strong> – Plan the night before what you need for the next school
day and take only what you need! Do not bring unnecessary items such as
big umbrellas or toys. Pack according to the lessons for the day.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;– Avoid heavy items. Opt for lighter water bottles
and pencil cases, where possible. Trolley bags are not recommended as they
are cumbersome and are a hassle when using the stairs. Bags should be lightweight
with cushions and adjustable straps.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&nbsp;– Carry your bag properly using both straps instead
of just one. This distributes the weight evenly across your shoulders and
will not cause unnecessary stress on your back.</p>
<p><strong>K</strong>&nbsp;– Keep proper posture.</p>
<p></p>

<p>For the well-being of our pupils, every pupil is provided a complimentary
use of lockers. These lockers are for you to store books and materials
not related to the four main subjects.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Based on guidelines by the Health Promotion Board, you should not be carrying
more than 10 – 15% of your body weight. Do use the template below to help
you in maintaining an acceptable bag weight.
