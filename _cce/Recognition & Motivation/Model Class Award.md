# **Model Class Award**

The Model Class Award is part of our school’s efforts to develop and recognise pupils in their Values, Skills and Knowledge on the platform of a class level so they may become useful and responsible citizens of good character.

This is also in line with our school philosophy of “Every Child Matters” and Holistic Awards Framework (HAF) so that we can:  
 
1.  Recognise pupils’ efforts and achievements
2.  Raise pupils’ performance
3.  Foster pupils’ motivation to learn
4.  Maximise pupils’ engagement to learn
