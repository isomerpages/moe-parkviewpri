**P4 LJ to Singapore Discovery Centre – Racial Harmony Day**

1 of our 6 NE Core Message states that, ‘We must always preserve Racial and Religious harmony’. It is imperative for our pupils to know the importance of understanding our differences and not let it hinder our unity. Therefore, as our pupils mature at P4, they will go for the Racial Harmony Day Exhibitions at Singapore Discovery Centre.

This experience:-

*   provides an awareness of the consequences of a breakdown in racial and religious harmony
*   drives home the message on the importance of peaceful co-existence for different races and religions
*   highlights the danger of taking racial and religious harmony for granted
