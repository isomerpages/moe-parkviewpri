<p align="justify">In PVPS, immersive language learning experiences are created for our students so that they can learn and appreciate the language in an environment that is conducive, creative, and joyful. These Language Learning Experience Activities in the English Classroom allow students to participate in stimulating classroom-based and outdoor authentic language learning activities. These Learning Experience Activities included lantern-making by the Primary 1 students, creating modelling clay burgers at Primary 2, outdoor exploration at Primary 3, weaving friendship bands and growing sunflowers at Primary 4, learning to be photographers at Primary 5 and surviving a crisis at Primary 6!</p>
