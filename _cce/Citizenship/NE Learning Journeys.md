# **NE Learning Journeys**

**National Education Learning Journeys**

In Park View, we provide an opportunity for our pupils to acquire and experience National Education through fun and interactive learning journeys. At the end of a pupils’ primary education, he/she would be equipped with the necessary knowledge to appreciate and understand the cultural diversities. Let us now take a look at our pupils’ P3-P6 learning journeys.

**P4 LJ to Singapore Discovery Centre – Racial Harmony Day**

1 of our 6 NE Core Message states that, ‘We must always preserve Racial and Religious harmony’. It is imperative for our pupils to know the importance of understanding our differences and not let it hinder our unity. Therefore, as our pupils mature at P4, they will go for the Racial Harmony Day Exhibitions at Singapore Discovery Centre.

This experience:-

*   provides an awareness of the consequences of a breakdown in racial and religious harmony
*   drives home the message on the importance of peaceful co-existence for different races and religions
*   highlights the danger of taking racial and religious harmony for granted

**P4 Heritage LJ to Kampong Glam**

As part of their Children’s Day celebrations, P4 pupils will go to Kampong Glam to get to know more about the Malay culture through food, fashion and music. Pupils will tour Malay cultural sites and explore the trade and occupations in Kampong Glam. They will also witness the different architectures of the residential and commercial sites. This experience allows our pupils to:-

*   discover the rich and vibrant heritage of our early Malay settlers
*   learn more about the Malay musical instruments, costumes and handicraft
*   use mathematics in context to solve inter-disciplinary word problems
*   experience how different races interact with one another in Singapore
