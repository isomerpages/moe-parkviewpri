<p>In Park View, we believe that every child is a leader. PVPS adopts a whole-school
approach to student leadership using a 3-tier approach, the ASK approach:</p>
<p>Leadership for <strong>A</strong>ll
<br>Leadership for <strong>S</strong>tudent Leadership Council
<br>Leadership for <strong>K</strong>ey Leaders</p>
<p></p>
<p>Student leadership programmes at each tier is designed to develop leadership
competencies and E21CC while anchoring our students in values. Every student
is given an opportunity to be a leader through our differentiated, student-centric
and values-driven programmes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Leadership for All" tier is aimed at embedding leadership qualities
across the entire student body. This foundational level ensures that every
student is exposed to leadership principles and practices, while carrying
out their duties as Class Committee Leaders (CCL) as well as attending
leadership workshops or applying leadership competencies through class
projects such as VIA. CCL roles are rotated on a semestral basis to facilitate
the children’s exploration of their strength and embrace of challenges.
Through this, the children can recognise their potential as leaders as
well as work on developing and improving their leadership competencies
while serving their class.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Leadership for Student Leadership Councils (SLC)</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;Leadership for Student Leadership Council focuses on developing
a smaller group of students who are formally recognized as SLC leaders
within the school. These students are often involved in championing causes
or focus areas of the respective SLCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;SLC Leaders are given opportunities to plan and implement school
events and programmes pertaining to the focus area of their SLC. They undergo
training, workshop and attend leadership camps to hone their leadership
skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;The SLC in PVPS comprises of the following:</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>At PVPS, prefects are servant leaders who lead by example and challenge
their peers to embody the school's shared values. They are role models,
inspiring the student body through their actions and commitment to upholding
the school’s ethos of respect, responsibility, and resilience.</p>
<p>Prefects represent the voice of the student population, leading school-wide
initiatives such as the C3 Challenge, collaboration projects with Cerebral
Palsy Alliance Singapore, Teachers’ Day celebrations, and outreach programme
to kindergartens. Through these projects, they foster a spirit of unity
and service within the school community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As school ambassadors, our prefects play a key role in various school
programmes and events, such as P1 Orientation, Little Stars and Broadway,
Speech Day, and National Education events like Total Defence Day and National
Day. Their presence at these events helps create a welcoming and positive
atmosphere, showcasing the pride and dedication of PVPS students.</p>
