<p align="justify">Park View Primary School Football CCA was started in 1998. Since then, we have taken part in the East Zone SPSSC Inter-Primary Football Championships, National Inter-Primary Football Championships, numerous FAS-led tournaments and friendlies.
<br>
At present, we have 76 active members, consisting of Primary 3 to Primary 6 boys, who train once or twice a week at the school field under the supervision of our coach, Mr. Fathi. We also have a dedicated team of teachers who supervise them during training sessions and accompany them out for tournaments and friendlies. 
<br>
We were taught various football skills, techniques and games to hone our skills. In 2016, our school players have adopted the PR2O Player Philosophy where we learn to be more reflective and responsible school team players through journal writing and mental resilience.
<br>
Together with our band of committed coach and teachers driving and inspiring the Football CCA, we hope to build on our achievements and strive to attain greater heights in the coming years.</p>
