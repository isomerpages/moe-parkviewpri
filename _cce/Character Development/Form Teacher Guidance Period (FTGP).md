# **Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)**

As Form Teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) has been introduced in all primary schools since 2012. 

The objectives of FTGP are to:  

\- provide quality interaction time betweeen form teachers and pupils, and   
\- equip pupils with social and emotional competencies.

In PVPS, FTGP is conducted from 8.00am - 8.30am on Tuesdays for all levels. The allocated one period per week carves out time for more quality teacher-pupil interaction and allows teachers to equip pupils with social and emotional competencies.

  

Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is explicitly taught during FTGP. Form and Co-Form Teachers conduct explicit teaching of Social and Emotional competencies to equip pupils with self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship management and responsible decision making skills. In addition, Form and Co-Form Teachers bond with pupils through interaction activities within the period. They also take turns to conduct One-to-One Sharing sessions with their pupils.

  

Mandatory lessons on Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) and protection from abuse have been incorporated in FTGP lessons to address specific issues, reinforce the core values and social and emotional competencies to enable pupils to apply them to the specific contexts.

  

During One-to-One sessions, Form or Co-Form Teachers allocate time to have a chit chat session with their pupils to know more about them so that they are able to guide and support them in the areas that were surfaced during the sessions.
