Library Etiquette
-----------------

1\.  The school library replicates a public library environment where good mannerisms are observed. PVPS pupils will exhibit their best behaviors within the library.
    
Good behavioral traits observed:
    
* Neat and tidy school attire
* Walking about softly to source for library books
* Speaking in a softer tone only when necessary. No group discussion is allowed.
* Consume water and food outside of the library compound. Notify the teacher for approval to step out of the library.
* Handle library book(s) with care and respect. Any torn or defaced pages within a found book should be brought to the librarian at the counter.
* Place back book(s) taken from the shelf back to its original position. If unsure of the original position, it may be brought to the librarian at the counter.
* Ensure only loaned books are brought out from the library.
* Students should refrain from bringing their own storybook from home into the library compound.
