# **Scouts**



Park View Primary School Scout Unit started in 2011.  We strive to develop our cub scouts so that they are ready and prepared to experience an interesting adventure that places a strong emphasis on contributing to society.  Our cub scouts work in a patrol system where the values of teamwork, trust and loyalty will always be honed. Outdoor Scouting, Sports and Hobbies, Science and Nature, Creativity, Knowing Your Community and Country, Taking Care of Oneself and Helping Others, and many other activities are all part of Cub Scouting.  The commemoration of our Founder’s Day and the Diamond Jubilee Challenge Fund Raising are the two major activities for 2022.  Outdoor activities will resume once the MOE and SSA have given the approval.  Cub Scouts will be guided through the process of completing their Scout Proficiency Book and earning Proficiency Badges.
