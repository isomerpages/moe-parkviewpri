#### Introduction

<p align="justify">Park View Primary School Volleyball Team was formed in 2001. Since its inception, it has distinguished itself as one of the powerhouses in primary school volleyball, clinching medals in zonal and national competitions in both the boys and girls division. The PVPS volleyball team has amassed many accolades through its long and proud history. Together with a team of committed and dedicated teachers, we hope to build on our achievements and scale greater heights in the coming years. </p>

The volleyball team provides differentiated training to students at varying levels.

At Primary 3, the focus is on developing basic skills through fun drills and games.

<p align="justify">At Primary 4, students will be working towards honing and perfecting their skills of serving, digging, setting, and spiking. To showcase and apply these skills, the students will have the opportunity to take part in the annual soft volleyball competition.</p>

<p align="justify">At Primary 5 and Primary 6, the training will center on exploring various offensive and defensive systems in order to prepare the teams for upcoming zonal and national competitions.</p>

<p align="justify"> Every training session will begin with a warm-up session of fitness and conditioning drills. It will be followed by team drills aimed at developing both basic and specific skills for that particular training session. The training will conclude with a game to allow students to put into practice the drills and skills learnt.</p>

<p align="justify">In order for students to see the importance of their learning process, each student is given PR2O Journal to document their reflections and skills learnt during training.</p>

<p align="justify">
School Team players are required to purchase a personal pair of knee guards for safety.</p>

<p align="justify">
Students are allowed to bring and change into their own sport shoes during training.</p>

<p align="justify">Girls with short or long hair are required to keep their hair tied or pinned up during training. Nails are also to be kept short for personal hygiene and safety.</p>
