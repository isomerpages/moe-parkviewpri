<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The Dance CCA was one of the first CCAs to be set up when the school started.
We had different ethnic dance groups those days. Over some years, equality
and diversity took great importance in our merger to Creative Dance CCA.
<br>Students are given the opportunity to discover and explore the various
dance forms and genres including Fusion and Contemporary Dance, developing
them to be versatile dancers. We have a team of dancers from various ethnic&nbsp;groups
and different nations. As such, this CCA provides them a platform to develop
cultural awareness.
<br>Creative Dance teaches respect, resilience and discipline alongside other
school values which are regularly reinforced by our team of dedicated teachers
and instructors. It also prides itself on the strong friendships forged
and rapport between the dancers, teachers, and instructors.</p>
