# **Primary 4 : PRIDE (Pasir Ris)**

Our P4 pupils participated in a meaningful Values in Action Project, in collaboration with Pasir Ris West Community Centre. Project Festive, with a focus on Community, is part of the school’s spiral approach in our VIA curriculum.

The pupils visited the neighbouring blocks of the school and gave out mandarin oranges and greeting cards to the residents. Pupils were excited and engaged in conversing with the residents using the Chinese New Year greetings that they learnt in class. To better prepare our pupils before Project Festive, pupils went through a series of structured lessons using the **PRIDE** (Pasir Ris, our home, where we **R**each out to the community and Improve the environment and create the **D**esired future for Pasir Ris through the **E**ngagement of self and others) package on the history of Pasir Ris, the importance of racial harmony in the neighbourhood, and the Do’s and Don’ts during Chinese New Year visitation.

Through the PRIDE approach, pupils are taught knowledge, values and skills through pre, actual and post VIA lessons. This VIA programme benefits our pupils as they develop a sense of belonging to the Pasir Ris neighbourhood and instill a sense of pride in them. It helps them understand the diversity of race, religion and practices in Singapore that promotes social cohesion and harmony in Singapore. Feedback from residents, teachers and pupils have been very positive and encouraging as the pupils were well-prepared and got to apply what they learnt for the VIA.

Pupils learnt servant leadership through the VIA litter picking activity. They learnt to empathize with the cleaners and that it was not an easy job.

**Our Primary 4 pupils learnt to:**

\-    recognize that they can make a contribution to care for the environment     
\-    make informed and responsible decisions as a citizen and do their part in conserving the environment
