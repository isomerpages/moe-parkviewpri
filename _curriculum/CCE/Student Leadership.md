<p>In Park View, we believe that every child is a leader. PVPS adopts a whole-school
approach to student leadership using a 3-tier approach, the ASK approach:</p>
<p>Leadership for <strong>A</strong>ll
<br>Leadership for <strong>S</strong>tudent Leadership Council
<br>Leadership for <strong>K</strong>ey Leaders</p>
<p></p>
<p>Student leadership programmes at each tier is designed to develop leadership
competencies and E21CC while anchoring our students in values. Every student
is given an opportunity to be a leader through our differentiated, student-centric
and values-driven programmes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Leadership for All" tier is aimed at embedding leadership qualities
across the entire student body. This foundational level ensures that every
student is exposed to leadership principles and practices, while carrying
out their duties as Class Committee Leaders (CCL) as well as attending
leadership workshops or applying leadership competencies through class
projects such as VIA. CCL roles are rotated on a semestral basis to facilitate
the childrenâ€™s exploration of their strength and embrace of challenges.
Through this, the children can recognise their potential as leaders as
well as work on developing and improving their leadership competencies
while serving their class.&nbsp;</p>
