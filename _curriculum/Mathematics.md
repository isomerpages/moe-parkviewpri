</div>
<p>The Singapore Mathematics Framework is centered around Mathematical Problem
Solving, supported by five key components: Concepts, Skills, Processes,
Metacognition, and Attitudes. It follows a structured approach where students
build a strong foundation through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA)
method, develop problem-solving strategies, and apply mathematical thinking
in real-world contexts. The framework emphasizes reasoning, communication,
and connections while nurturing critical thinking, perseverance, and confidence
in learners.</p>
<p>Through the school's Enrich, Support, and Stretch (ESS) approach, the
Singapore Mathematics Framework ensures that all students, regardless of
their learning needs, develop mathematical mastery and a deep appreciation
for the subject. The Support component provides targeted interventions
to build a strong foundation, while Enrich enhances learning through problem-solving,
inquiry based learning and critical thinking. Stretch offers opportunities
to explore advanced concepts and apply creative strategies. This differentiated
approach fosters confidence, perseverance, and a growth mindset, equipping
students with essential skills to excel in mathematics and beyond.</p>

<h4><strong>STAR Problem Solving</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Curriculum/Math/STAR.png">
</div>
<p>The Mathematics Department adopts the STAR approach, a structured 4-phase
process designed to equip students with essential problem-solving skills
and confidence in tackling real-world mathematical challenges. Grounded
in George Polya’s problem-solving technique, this approach provides a systematic
framework to guide students in understanding, strategizing, solving, and
reflecting on problems effectively.</p>

<h4><strong>The Math Adventures</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 30%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Curriculum/Math/Math_Adventure.png">
</div>
<p>The Math Adventures Programme is designed to ignite a passion for learning
mathematics while fostering self-directed learning in students. Through
engaging and thought-provoking activities, students develop confidence,
curiosity, and a deeper appreciation for mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>As part of this programme, students complete a series of independent activities,
which can be done both in school and at home. Upon submission, mathematics
teachers will acknowledge and validate their progress by recording their
accomplishments on their personal achievement cards.</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to attain different achievement levels based
on the number of activities they complete. To celebrate their efforts and
perseverance, they will receive recognition and rewards, motivating them
to continue their mathematical journey with enthusiasm and determination.</p>
<h4><strong>Math Adventure Recess Activities</strong></h4>
<p>The Math Adventure Recess Activities provide students with a fun and engaging
way to explore mathematics beyond the classroom. Held during recess, these
interactive activities encourage students to apply mathematical concepts
through games, puzzles, and hands-on challenges.</p>
<p>By participating, students enhance their problem-solving skills, logical
reasoning, and mathematical fluency in an enjoyable and stress-free environment.
These activities also foster collaboration and friendly competition, allowing
students to learn from their peers while developing a deeper appreciation
for mathematics.</p>

<h4><strong>Math Adventure Card</strong></h4>
<p>The Math Adventure Card is a motivational tool designed to track students’
progress and achievements in the Math Adventures Programme. Each time a
student completes a math-related activity—whether in school, at home, or
during recess—they earn a stamp or signature on their card as recognition
of their effort and perseverance.</p>

<h4><strong>E2K (Excellence 2000) Mathematics Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The E2K (Excellence 2000) Mathematics Programme is a specialised enrichment
programme designed for Primary 4 to 6 high-progress learners with a passion
for mathematics. Students in the E2K programme engage in challenging mathematical
tasks, hands-on explorations, and collaborative discussions, allowing them
to deepen their understanding of advanced mathematical concepts beyond
the standard curriculum. The programme also encourages independent learning
and creativity, fostering a growth mindset and perseverance in tackling
complex problems.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an intervention
programme in Singapore aimed at helping Primary 1 to 4 students who need
additional support in developing foundational numeracy skills. It provides
targeted, small-group instruction to students who face challenges with
basic mathematical concepts, ensuring they build confidence and competence
in mathematics. The programme is designed with structured lessons that
emphasize hands-on activities, visual representations, and step-by-step
guidance to strengthen students’ understanding and problem-solving skills.
By addressing learning gaps early, LSM helps students progress alongside
their peers in their mathematical learning journey​.</p>
