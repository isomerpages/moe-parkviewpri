# **Music Appreciation**

### PVPS Got Talents

**PVPS Got Talents** aims to provide talented pupils a platform to showcase their talents and also to cultivate audience and performers etiquette in the audience and performers respectively. Through the program, we have identified selected pupils to take part in external music competitions.

As the aesthetics department is constantly looking for new talents to sign up and perform. We highly encourage your child to take up the challenge to sign up for a performance during recess time. We look forward to having your child participate in our next PVPS Got Talent performance!

### Jukebox

**My Jukebox** project seeks to encourage pupils to listen to the ‘right’ type of popular music. Every once a month, the Aesthetics Ambassadors will gather pupil’s song request with their personal inspirational message to share and present it during the morning assembly. Pupils are encouraged to sing and move along to their favourite tunes during recess. Suitable song requests would be used for the Active Monday workout and ACES Day workout.

Objectives:

*   To promote community singing
*   To encourage pupils to listen to the ‘right’ type of music
*   To infuse CCE values through music
*   Promoting a vibrant arts culture
