The CITE approach consists of the following:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Create an awareness of NE in our pupils through the various NE programmes like class pledge-taking, commemoration of core-NE events, NE Talks and reflections etc.</p></li><li><p>Integrate NE into our curriculum in the form of inter-departmental ownership for NE activities such as Young Nation Builder Card.</p></li><li><p>Teach our teachers with the necessary skills to conduct NE programmes and Social Studies lessons so that our pupils will enjoy and be engaged in their NESS activities and lessons.</p></li><li><p>Experience NE and learn about the uniqueness of Singapore through learning journeys. Through these experiential journeys, it is hoped that our pupils will learn more about the respective races, practices and cultures, and learn the value of respect and thus appreciate the different races in our multi-racial and cultural Singapore.</p></li></ul><h4></h4><h4></h4><p></p>
