Warmest greetings to all and welcome to Park View Primary School.

“Park View   
You are special   
Park View   
Together we will make you shine   
You are special   
Park View”

\-        Park View Primary School Song

The chorus of our school song above encompasses what we at Park View strive to do – to make each and every student shine. I am truly humbled to have been given the opportunity to be part of the Park View family, indeed a special place that seeks to bring out the best in every child. As I have been so warmly welcomed by the Park View family, I too would like to extend this generous welcome to our incoming Primary 1 students as well as our returning Primary 2 to 6 students for 2022. I look forward to meeting all of you in the new academic year.

The past 2 years have been a challenging for all, however, in the past months that I have since joined the school, I have witnessed resilience, tenacity and a sense of positive energy being displayed by the students, teaching and non-teaching staff as well as our parents. The pandemic has allowed us to seize opportunities to turn them into possibilities and our students continue to grow stronger in spite of the challenges faced. This is testament to what we at Park View believe in and is true to our school vision of developing “Leaders of Character; championing Service and Excellence”.

**_Growing the child through the Park View Experience_**

In their 6 years with us, we strive to provide our students with the Park View Experience, which seeks to create a learning environment where our students are able to grow and excel holistically with strength of character. The school’s niche programmes in “Innovation through Service and Leadership” (our Applied Learning Programme) and “Sports Experiential Programme” (our Learn for Life Programme) continue to nurture innovation and creativity in our students and more importantly, prepare them for the future. These programmes, alongside the school’s curricular and co-curricular experiences as well as with our caring and dedicated staff, are key to developing a well-rounded Park View student, who will be able to lead and care for others.

**_Celebrating 25 Years_**

As we celebrate our 25th Anniversary in 2022, it is timely to look back and be grateful and proud of our achievements thus far! Our achievements could not have been accomplished without the hard work of our people, the strong support from our partners and the determination of our students. I am thankful to my predecessors, who have laid a strong foundation at Park View. As we have flown the Park View flag high in the Pasir Ris community the past 25 years, we will continue our journey forward together. The landscape is changing fast and with it comes new challenges and disruptions, but I am confident, we will be able to seize the challenges to turn them into opportunities and possibilities for everyone!

As the Park View school song goes,

“Our crest gleaming bright   
Our heads held up high  
Park View  
You are special  
Park View   
Together we will make you shine!”

Let us continue to look ahead to 2022, heads held high and reimagine the possibilities that lie ahead for our Park View students!
