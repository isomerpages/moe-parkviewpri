PVPS Netball was introduced to the school for the girls in 2000. We have a very committed coach, as well as teachers and players who work together to achieve our goals.

Netball builds team spirit and team building as it is not an individual sport. Through netball, our girls not only acquire the skills of the game but also develop their bond and friendship with one another through their training sessions. It always involves a team effort and it is truly a fun and exciting game.

In Netball, we believe in developing each player to her fullest potential in the sport. We nurture our players’ character anchored on our school’s shared values ‘Respect for All’, ‘Responsibility in Action’, ‘Resilience in Adversity’, ‘Integrity our Core’, ‘Care for Community’ and ‘Harmony in Diversity’. We believe that our players will grow to be people of exemplary character if they are able to be disciplined in managing the demands of school work and CCA.
