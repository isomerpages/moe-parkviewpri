### Mathematics Framework

![](/images/Math_FW.jpg)

The teaching and learning of mathematics aims primarily to equip pupils with a firm foundation of knowledge and skills in mathematics. The central focus of our mathematics framework is problem solving, which is supported by five interrelated dimensions: concepts, skills, processes, attitudes and metacognition. Excellence in mathematics anchors in problem solving, and through problem solving, pupils are developed into thinkers and problem solvers, who are independent, engaged, creative and critical.

To achieve our vision, our approach is Delivery, Interest, Application and Assessment (DIAA). The four approaches play specific roles to realize our desired outcomes:  

*   Cultivate and enhance pupils’ interest to keep them connected, motivated and driven in problem solving.
*   Equip pupils with a strong foundation in concepts, skills, thinking process and metacognition through various effective instructional programmes, pedagogy and learning experiences.
*   Provide opportunity and exposure for pupils to use and apply mathematics in challenging tasks, non-routine questions, investigations and real life problem.
*   Adopt a holistic approach to assessment to facilitate effective instructional planning and to account for pupils’ progress and support their learning.
