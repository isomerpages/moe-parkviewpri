*   Quality of Homework
*   Amount of homework/Time spent
*   Tracking
*   Degree of Flexibility

**Level of Difficulty**  

*   Homework should be appropriate to pupils’ abilities and be within their developmental readiness.
*   As such, there would be differentiated homework given to pupils of different abilities.

**Quality of homework**  

*   Homework must be well-thought through and quality in nature.
*   A well-designed homework should:

*   be purposeful and encourage critical thinking;
*   be worth doing and related to class teaching;
*   be explicit and clearly defined so that pupils clearly understand what is required of them; and
*   involve the use of only material resources that are known to be readily available to pupils;

**Amount of homework / Time spent**

*   The specific amount of homework are generally based on pupil needs.
*   The quantity of homework assigned take into consideration the following:

	*   Adequate time for family bonding, social activities, personal interests and rest;
	*   Age-appropriate and take into account the competing demands on pupils’ time ;
	*   Coordination of assigning homework;
	*   Differentiation by academic courses or ability level.

*   Time spent on homework varies from level to level.
*   Teachers follow a set of guidelines when giving homework to pupils.
*   There is flexibility for EMS teachers to give more than the norm if coordination is done among the class subject teachers.
*   For non-examinable subjects (HE, SS, etc), subject teachers will give pupils at least one week to complete their work

**Tracking of homework**  

*   Use of homework board - All assignments are written on the board (in the homework column), specified with the issued and due date.

**Flexibility**  

*   Teachers will set realistic deadline for homework given.
*   If pupils are not able to complete the homework by the due date due to good reason, they should inform the teachers.
