#### ORAL SELF-ASSESSMENT PACKAGE:

<p align="justify">This year, our teachers developed an oral package for our students to develop them into effective communicators. The oral package is interactive and teaches students how to assess themselves for the reading and speaking components. Students will be able to hear examples of reading and speaking which will be accompanied by a discussion and the band achieved by the student. Using this as a guide, students will be able to assess their performance. They will also be able to identify their target band and continue to work towards reaching it. This package hopes to develop students to become competent speakers of the language. This package was rolled out in Term 4 this year and will undergo further refinements for 2022.</p>
