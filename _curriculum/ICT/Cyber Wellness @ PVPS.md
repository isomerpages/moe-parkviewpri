<p align="justify">What is Cyber Wellness?

Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of the risks of harmful online behaviors, an awareness of how to protect oneself and other Internet users from such behaviors.</p>

<p align="justify">PVPS adapts MOE’s Sense-Think-Act framework to develop pupils’ instinct to protect and empower them to take responsibility for their well-being in cyberspace. The two principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’ and ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ when adhered to will anchor pupils’ well-being in cyberspace as they will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.</p>

PVPS also collaborates with FamilyMatters@School to engage TOUCH Cyber Wellness to train and
