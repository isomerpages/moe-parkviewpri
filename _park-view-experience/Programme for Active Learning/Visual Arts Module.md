# **Visual Arts Module**

**A synopsis of PAL Visual Arts**

Visual arts is one of the 3 domains of PAL and it focuses on ‘Doodling’. The aim is to provide students with the opportunity to experience the creativity and imagination involved in the world of cartooning and doodling. Through this module, students have the chance to discover their aptitude and interests, develop their confidence and creativity and hone their drawing and colouring skills through fun learning activities. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is also incorporated in every PAL lesson to promote positive social and emotional development in the students.

The students carried out the following activities during PAL (Visual Arts) module:
