# **Performing Arts Events**

The major function of art is to make objective and therefore accessible the subjective realm of human responsiveness. Art does this by capturing and presenting in its intrinsic qualities the patterns and form of human feeling… Education in the arts, then, can be regarded as the education of feeling” - Reimer (1989, p. 153)

Music helps us express ourselves more than words can. Music is not confined by language but transients all language which everyone can understand. At Park View Primary School, we aim to provide platforms for our pupils to perform/participate in. Pupils are given opportunities to express, expose, excel and appreciate the arts through the various platforms. Below are some of the events in Park View Primary School. All these events aim to build pupils’ self-confidence and develop their stage etiquette.

  

### Musical Productions

#### P1 Little Stars & P2 Broadway


Light! Camera! Action! Little Star and Broadway@PVPS - our very own production of dance and drama at "Hotspot", our library cum Performing Art Theatre, is a yearly highlight every parent and pupil look forward to in November. Our Primary 1 and 2 pupils have the opportunity to showcase their skills that they have acquired during their Speech & Drama lessons, as well as the Aesthetics module of PAL. The pupils are to express themselves creatively through creative movements and also stretch their imagination in acting.
