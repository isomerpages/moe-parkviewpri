#### Key Programmes

#### HARI RAYA CELEBRATION

<p align="justify">The Hari Raya Celebration at Park View Primary School this year took a different spin as the celebration was done via ZOOM. The celebration started with a quiz on Hari Raya featuring our two non-Muslim teachers to test their knowledge on Hari Raya. This was followed by another video by our P5 students, Haziq Rayyan, Nur Raudha & Shaistah Nadia sharing about Hari Raya. The celebration ended with a dance featuring our wonderful teachers and school leaders!</p>

<b>Do enjoy the videos below!</b>
