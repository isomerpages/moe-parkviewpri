<p>Greetings from Park View Primary School as we welcome the new year! We
hope you have enjoyed a restful year-end break with your children.
<br>
<br>As we step into a new school year, we look back with gratitude and pride
on the many meaningful moments of 2025. It was a year filled with growth,
perseverance, and achievement for our students. From our Primary 1 students
confidently completing their first year of in primary school, to our Primary
6 cohort concluding their primary school journey after the PSLE; each child
has demonstrated resilience and determination in their own unique way.
We are especially proud of the Class of 2025 for their commendable performance
in the PSLE. With our students progressing on to their choice Secondary
School, this achievement reflects not only their hard work, but also the
strong partnership between our dedicated teachers and supportive parents
who have guided our students every step of the way. All our other students
have also reached new milestones as they progressed to new levels, adapted
to fresh challenges, and formed new friendships. It has truly been a fulfilling
year for the entire Park View family. As we congratulate and bid farewell
to our graduating cohort, we are delighted to welcome the new Primary 1
students of 2026. Starting a new school journey may bring both excitement
and uncertainty, but we are confident that our newest members of the Park
View family will soon feel right at home in our caring and vibrant community.
<br>As we look ahead to a promising and dynamic 2026, we reaffirm our commitment
to nurturing every child into a Leader of Character. Holistic development
remains at the heart of the Park View Experience, and we will continue
to provide a wide range of engaging academic and co-curricular programmes
that build confidence, curiosity, and a love for learning. Through these
opportunities, we hope to empower our students to become self-directed
learners who serve with purpose and strive for excellence—living out our
vision of being “Leaders of Character, championing Service and Excellence.”
We extend our heartfelt appreciation to our parents for your continued
trust and partnership. Your support plays a vital role in your child’s
success, and we look forward to working closely with you in the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 2025 be filled with happiness, good health, and many new achievements
for every family. On behalf of the Park View Primary School community,
we wish you and your loved ones a joyful and fulfilling New Year.</p>
