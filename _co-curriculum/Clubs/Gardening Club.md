Park View Primary School Gardening Club has been established since 2013. It is currently run by Mdm Zahrah and Miss June Quek and has a strength of 33 students under their charge.

The gardening members are given the opportunity to tend to the plants in the different gardening plots around the school like the spice garden, cactus garden, flowering garden and fern garden and learn about their adaption.&nbsp;

They are involved in basic gardening activities like weeding, watering, pruning to ensure that the plants grow healthily. The members are also exposed to other gardening techniques like growing hydroponic plants, making of terrarium, landscaping design and creating organic fertilizer.&nbsp;

The Gardening Club aims to promote a deeper appreciation of greenery amongst the students and foster a greater social interaction and bonding within the students in the CCA.

It also aims to promote awareness of the diversity of plants and to educate students on ways to care for the different types of plants.
