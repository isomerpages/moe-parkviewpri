# **Modular Music**

**_P2 Vocal Enrichment Programme_**  

Singing is important in developing a child’s musical sense. It helps a child express their feelings and ideas through singing. Through songs, children learn about themselves and the world around them. It also develops their listening, cooperative skills, concentration skills, memory and enhances creativity. It is through singing and performing that children become more self-confident.

The vocal training lessons seek to achieve these:

a)    To equip pupils with basic knowledge of singing: breath, voice, pitch, rhythm and diction

b)    To equip pupils with a comprehensive understanding of vocal technique using various songs

c)    To expose pupils to various genres of music

d)    To develop in pupils a keen appreciation of the arts

Duration: Term 3 (9 hours)

**_P3 Ukulele Module_**

The ukulele module is a new music programme initiative for all P3 pupils. The ukulele has become increasingly popular in recent times because of its size and its unique sound. It is easier to learn and serves as a good stepping stone for pupils to learn the guitar at P5. As part of our broad-based arts approach, this programme is aimed at introducing pupils to the ukulele instrument. The module will give pupils a better understanding of the anatomy of the ukulele, the various chord progressions and using the instrument to express themselves through music. The module will be conducted in-house by our trained music teachers. Through this module, we will build our pupils’ foundation in rhythm and their aural abilities.

Objectives:

In this programme, pupils will learn how to:

*   identify the parts of the ukulele
*   learn at least 4 chords on the ukulele
*   perform at least 3 songs on the ukulele
*   learn at least 3 strumming patterns
