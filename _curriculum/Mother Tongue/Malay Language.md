<p><em>As part of their training, our two ambassadors attended A Newsmaker Session organised by NLB. They then participated in the Newsmaker Competition in which they had to write a script and act out a scene based on a Malay Legend or Folklore. They decided on ‘Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup’, which tells the story of a mother, who was so disappointed that the son finished up all the food, leaving her none. Out of disappointment, she went to a cave and eventually got swallowed by the cave.</em>

This was followed by another video by our P5 students, Haziq Rayyan, Nur Raudha &amp; Shaistah Nadia sharing about Hari Raya. The celebration ended with a dance featuring our wonderful teachers and school leaders!</em>

<h4><em>Assessment</em></h4>
<p><strong><em>ORAL SELF-ASSESSMENT PACKAGE:</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>This year, our teachers developed an oral package for our students to develop them into effective communicators. The oral package is interactive and teaches students how to assess themselves for the reading and speaking components. Students will be able to hear examples of reading and speaking which will be accompanied by a discussion and the band achieved by the student. Using this as a guide, students will be able to assess their performance. They will also be able to identify their target band and continue to work towards reaching it. This package hopes to develop students to become competent speakers of the language. This package was rolled out in Term 4 this year and will undergo further refinements for 2022.</em>
