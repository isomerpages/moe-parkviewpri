<h4>Excursion</h4>
<p>The school expands and extends the learning environment of the students
beyond the classrooms by bringing them to visit museums, galleries, and
theatres.</p>
<h4>Place-based Learning</h4>
<p><strong><em>Roving Art Truck</em></strong>
</p>
<p>How would it be like to encounter art on a truck? Follow Thumbs Up to
visit the Roving Art Truck parked at Park View Primary! A colourful art
truck has arrived at Park View Primary. Packed within the truck is an exhibition
of 10 paintings by local and South East Asia artists, and students are
able to see them all at one go.</p>
<p>9 year old Devi Sravanthi is one of the first few to step foot on the
Roving Art Truck. She heard about the truck previously and was eagerly
waiting for it to arrive in school. When the truck came, she rushed to
visit the exhibition during her recess time.</p>
<p>Sravanthi’s ambition was to become an artist when she grows up. She said,
“I have never visited the National Gallery and have only seen art exhibitions
on videos. The experience of listening to the commentator explaining about
the stories behind every artwork, is a very enriching one.”</p>
<p>10 years old Jaylen Wong Yi Cong has the opportunity to visit the museum
once every year. Earlier this year, he has also participated in the virtual
tour organised by the National Gallery, hence he is able to identify many
of the artworks on the Roving Art Truck.</p>
<p>He said, “The experience of seeing an artwork virtually and seeing it
in real is very different. The gallery is a very quiet space and that creates
an experience. Also, the artworks in reality are actually very huge and
majestic.”</p>
<p>Other than paintings, there is an art wall for students to express themselves
and leave comments and thoughts after their visit. The art wall will be
left behind for the school when the truck leaves for another destination.</p>
<p>Head of Aesthetics Miss Lim Hwee Tin felt that this exposure is just the
tip of an iceberg and she hopes this experience would spark the interest
in art for students and open the doors to more art activities.</p>

<h4>Primary 2 Art-in-Transit</h4>
<p>The Art-in-Transit programme provides our students with learning experiences
beyond the classrooms, exposing them to the art installations in the MRT
stations and providing insight into the history of the community in which
the stations are located. Besides art appreciation, the infusion of English
and Mathematics activities through the artworks allows our students to
learn English and Mathematics in authentic and meaningful context, thereby
enabling them to see the interconnectedness between the subjects.</p>

<h4><u>Projects</u></h4>
<p><strong>In Partnership with Arts Education Branch (AEB): SLS Art Resources for Primary Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the ministry’s effort to transform learning experiences of
students through purposeful use of technology, and in providing for students
with greater access to arts learning, the Arts Education Branch (AEB) has
been developing student learning resources that are made available for
schools on Student Learning Space (SLS). AEB collaborated with Park View
Primary School to develop the Student Artist Talk Video Series, which featured
two Primary 6 students, Leila Koh (6D), and Tan Yan Yi (6B), who shared
their artistic processes behind the artwork created for the Singapore Youth
Festival Art Exhibition. The artwork, entitled “Waves of Life”, received
the Certificate of Recognition (Special Mention). Leila and Yan Yi also
shared the art concepts through discussing about and reflecting on the
artwork.</p>

<h4><em>Art Outreach Community Outreach Programme through Recycled Art</em></h4>
<p><em>Art Club members, in collaboration with the Green Ambassadors, carry out the yearly Community Outreach Programme through Recycled Art by reaching out to the kindergarten students to share with them the importance of environment conservation and how they can do their part to protect mother Earth.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Through simple craftwork, the Art Club members teach the kindergarten students how to transform common household trash such as toilet rolls, bottle caps and plastic bottles into useful craftwork.
