### Library Etiquette

1\.  The school library replicates a public library environment where good mannerisms are observed. PVPS pupils will exhibit their best behaviors within the library.
    
Good behavioral traits observed:
    
* Neat and tidy school attire
* Walking about softly to source for library books
* Speaking in a softer tone only when necessary. No group discussion is allowed.
* Consume water and food outside of the library compound. Notify the teacher for approval to step out of the library.
* Handle library book(s) with care and respect. Any torn or defaced pages within a found book should be brought to the librarian at the counter.
* Place back book(s) taken from the shelf back to its original position. If unsure of the original position, it may be brought to the librarian at the counter.
* Ensure only loaned books are brought out from the library.
* Students should refrain from bringing their own storybook from home into the library compound.

### Library Policy

All pupils are automatically registered as a member of the school library.

### Overdue Loan Policy

Pupils can only borrow other library books only after they return their library books(s) by the stipulated due date.

They should exhibit the courtesy to inform the librarian of their overdue loans and return to the library as soon as they could.

### Lost or Damaged Items

Pupils are responsible for all library items borrowed from the library. For every item lost or damaged, pupils would be required to replace the item in kind.

They should approach the librarian to sign a Lost/Damaged Item form and obtain details (author, title and price) of lost library book(s).

Replacement book(s) will be subjected to the approval of the Library Coordinator. The replacement book should be of the same title or author of the lost or damaged book. Should the same title or authored book cannot be found, a book of the same price may be accepted but is subject to the Library Coordinator’s approval.
