<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Park View Primary School Volleyball Team was formed in 2001. Since its
inception, it has distinguished itself as one of the powerhouses in primary
school volleyball, clinching medals in zonal and national competitions
in both the boys and girlsâ€™ division. The PVPS volleyball team has amassed
many accolades through its long and proud history. Together with a team
of committed and dedicated teachers, we hope to build on our achievements
and scale greater heights in the coming years.
<br>The volleyball team provides differentiated training to students at varying
levels. At Primary 3, the focus is on developing basic skills through fun
drills and games. At Primary 4, students will be working towards honing
and perfecting their skills of serving, digging, setting and spiking. To
showcase and apply these skills, the students will have the opportunity
to take part in the annual soft volleyball competition. At Primary 5 and
Primary 6, the training will center on exploring various offensive and
defensive systems in order to prepare the teams for upcoming zonal and
national competitions.
<br>Every training session will begin with a warm-up session of fitness and
conditioning drills. It will be followed by team drills aimed at developing
both basic and specific skills. The training will conclude with a game
to allow students to put into practice the drills and skills learnt.
<br>For students to see the importance of their learning process, each student
is given the PR2O Journal to document their reflections and skills learnt
during training.
<br>School Team players are required to purchase a personal pair of volleyball
kneepads for safety.
<br>Students are allowed to bring and change into their own sport shoes during
training.
<br>Girls with short or long hair are required to keep their hair tied or
pinned up during training. Nails are also to be kept short for personal
hygiene and safety.</p>
