# **Homework Board P1 & P2**

**The online version of the homework boards serves as an additional channel for parents’ reference.**

**In cases where students may have forgotten to take down the homework assigned to them, the online version allows parents to help themselves to the information through this platform.**

**Pupils are still expected to exercise personal responsibility in taking down their homework assignments in their Pupil’s Handbook in class.**

**Parents are expected to check your child’s Handbook daily to monitor the homework assignments and take pro-active steps in building up the discipline of your child towards taking personal responsibility.**

The Homework Board will be updated between _4pm ~ 6pm_ daily.  

PVPS Homework Boards are by the week (Monday to Friday).
