<h4>After thoughts, Best Wishes Corner (ABC)</h4><p>In order to promote a culture of appreciation and gain deeper reflections about school programmes and events, the ABC (<strong>A</strong>fter thoughts,&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>est wishes&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>orner) was conceptualized. Teachers and pupils tap on their creativity in designing cards to express their best wishes or show their appreciation. It is also used for pupils to pen down their reflections after different school based programmes/ events to promote better learning. The sharings promoted camaraderie and a greater sense of belonging amongst pupils as they learn more about their schoolmates’ thoughts and feelings about school, its people and programmes.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ABC_Board.jpg"></div><h4>Model Class Award</h4><p>The Model Class Award is part of our school’s efforts to develop and recognise pupils in their Values, Skills and Knowledge on the platform of a class level so they may become useful and responsible citizens of good character.</p><p>This is also in line with our school philosophy of “Every Child Matters” and Holistic Awards Framework (HAF) so that we can:</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Recognise pupils’ efforts and achievements</p></li><li><p>Raise pupils’ performance</p></li><li><p>Foster pupils’ motivation to learn</p></li><li><p>Maximise pupils’ engagement to learn</p></li></ol><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>CCE Areas</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>What it teaches</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Knowledge</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><em>What self-discipline means and entails and what it looks like in practice</em></p></li><li><p><em>The need to make the right decisions</em></p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Skills</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Cooperation amongst peers</p></li><li><p>Self-Discipline</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Values /Attitudes</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Consideration for others’ thoughts and feelings</p></li><li><p>Responsibility in caring for one’s own well-being</p></li><li><p>Harmony with others</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Example of Monthly Themes &amp; Processes</strong></p><p>A theme is announced monthly and every class will be observed and judged for the month by either teachers or parent volunteers.
