### In Partnership with Arts Education Branch (AEB): 2020 SLS Art Resources for Primary Schools

As part of the ministry’s effort to transform learning experiences of students through purposeful use of technology, and in providing for students with greater access to arts learning, the Arts Education Branch (AEB) has been developing student learning resources that are made available for schools on Student Learning Space (SLS).

AEB collaborated with Park View Primary School to develop the **Student Artist Talk Video Series**, which featured two Primary 6 students, **Leila Koh (6D)**, and **Tan Yan Yi (6B)**, who shared their artistic processes behind the artwork created for the Singapore Youth Festival 2019 Art Exhibition. The artwork, entitled “Waves of Life”, received the Certificate of Recognition (Special Mention). Leila and Yan Yi also shared the art concepts through discussing about and reflecting on the artwork.
