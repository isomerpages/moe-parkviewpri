# **Training & Development**

To maximise the effectiveness of our Pupil Leadership Development Programme, different training and programmes are designed for each of the 3 approaches.

**Leadership for All**

All P1 to P6 pupils in PVPS will undergo the General Level Pupil Leadership Training which will allow a progressive development of leadership skills and qualities in pupils. In order to provide leadership opportunities for all pupils, the Class Committee Leadership (CCL) programme is put in place. The focus is on classroom responsibilities.

Under the CCL, every pupil is given the opportunity to be a class committee leader at least once a year. Pupils are rotated once a term or semester.

  

The various leadership positions under the CCL are:

| Primary 1 - 3 	| Primary 4 - 6 	|
