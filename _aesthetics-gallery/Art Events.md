### Beijing-Singapore DoodlePal Exchange Programme – 2016

In commemoration of International Friendship Day, Park View Primary School once again partnered Zhongguancun Number 4 School in Beijing, in Arts activities which included doodling and postcard exchange. Through this partnership, we aim to:

*   strengthen the friendship between the two schools
*   provide opportunities for students to appreciate cultural diversity and foster a willingness to embrace others from diverse background
*   provide a platform for students from both countries to form friendships through Art and postcard exchange

Primary 4 students created artworks based on the theme “Local Delicacies （当地美食）and Places of Interest（ 新加坡名胜地）while Primary 5 students wrote on specially designed postcards based on similar themes. Both schools exchanged artworks, postcards and students’ profiles, in which our students shared about their hobbies and recommended their favourite places of interest in Singapore. Photographs in the form of montages were also shared via the school website and social media platforms. In addition, a wall display was also created to showcase artworks and postcards created by students from both schools to celebrate this significant partnership.

### International Collaboration with Zhongguancun Number 4 Primary | Beijing–Singapore DoodlePAL activity

As part of Park View Primary School’s outreach framework which includes global exchange to develop the 21 CC in our pupils, the school initiated the inaugural Beijing-Singapore DoodlePAL Art activity. We partnered Zhongguancun Number 4 Primary in Beijing, whereby pupils from both countries worked on a squiggle created by the principal and vice-principal from both school respectively.

The objectives of this partnership are to strengthen the understanding and friendship between Zhongguancun No. 4 Primary and Park View Primary, and provide a platform for pupils from both countries to form friendship through art, thereby deepening one’s understanding of the country and their culture.

This DoodlePAL Art activity was carried out in conjunction with the International Friendship Week which began from 6-10 April 2015. All the P3 pupils created artworks based on the theme “International Friendship”.

Both schools exchanged the artworks created and they also completed a profile each to accompany their artworks. This allowed the pupils to get to know their friends from another country. The P3 pupils also wrote on the ‘Post Your Love’ cards for their friends in Beijing. Selected artworks from both countries were also installed in PVPS and Zhongguancun Number 4 Primary to mark the collaboration effort by both countries.

### Singapore Book of Records

**SBoR 2016 - Largest Display of Paper Plate Crafts**

This year, Park View Primary embarked on yet another record breaking feat to:

*   promote environmental conservation through recycling as a prelude to the Mid-Autumn celebrations.
*   engage the whole school as **ONE** in the breaking of Singapore Book of Record by creating the largest display of paper plate crafts.

This exciting and meaningful project produced **1952** paper plate crafts. It was achieved through the fantastic team effort of our students, staff, canteen vendors, contract cleaning crew, Parent Support Group, PVPS Alumni and partners like PCF Pasir Ris West, Sparkle Care@Changi and Club Rainbow. Each of them played a critical role in the project by contributing at least one paper plate craft. This project successfully entered into the Singapore Book of Records on 31 August 2016.

It was an exciting moment for everyone when our collective efforts and synergy as a school with our partners alongside us were recognised. All the artworks were beautifully installed by the PSG in the school. Do visit our school and be amazed by our PVPS Waves of Paper Plates! You can also visit the website on Singapore Book of Records to view our display.
