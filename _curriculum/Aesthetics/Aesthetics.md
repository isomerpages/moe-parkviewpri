### PVPS Aesthetics Framework

![](/images/Aesthetics%20Framework.jpg)

The Aesthetics programme in PVPS is designed in alignment with the Arts Framework. It aims to develop our students in the Cognitive (Knowledge), Affective (Attitude) and Psychomotor (Skills) domains. Through our 4**E** (**Exposure, Expression, Excursion, Excellence**) approach, we aim to develop and harness the full range of our students' talents and contribute to their overall development. With a strong emphasis on 21st century competencies, our programme seeks not only to develop future arts practitioners and audiences imbued with a sense of aesthetics, but also individuals who are civic-minded, cultivated, gracious and able to express themselves through various art forms. Through the arts, we expose our students to local and global cultures, enabling them to gain a better understanding of the world and bridge the gap between cultures. It is a powerful tool that can improve communication and relationships between cultures. They will also have a keen sense of the Singaporean identity and a spirit of experimentation and innovation.

**_P3 and 4 Ukulele_**  
The ukulele has become increasingly popular in recent times because of its size and its unique sound. It is easier to learn and serves as a good stepping stone for students to learn the guitar at P5. As part of our broad-based arts approach, this programme is aimed at introducing students to the ukulele instrument. The module will give them a better understanding of the anatomy of the ukulele, the various chord progressions and using the instrument to express themselves through music. Through this module, we will build our students’ foundation in rhythm and their aural abilities.

How would it be like to encounter art on a truck? Follow Thumbs Up to visit the Roving Art Truck parked at Park View Primary!  

A colourful art truck has arrived at Park View Primary. Packed within the truck is an exhibition of 10 paintings by local and South East Asia artists, and students are able to see them all at one go. 

9 year old Devi Sravanthi is one of the first few to step foot on the Roving Art Truck. She heard about the truck previously and was eagerly waiting for it to arrive in school. When the truck came, she rushed to visit the exhibition during her recess time. 

Sravanthi’s ambition was to become an artist when she grows up. She said, “I have never visited the National Gallery and have only seen art exhibitions on videos. The experience of listening to the commentator explaining about the stories behind every artwork, is a very enriching one.”

10 years old Jaylen Wong Yi Cong has the opportunity to visit the museum once every year. Earlier this year, he has also participated in the virtual tour organised by the National Gallery, hence he is able to identify many of the artworks on the Roving Art Truck.

He said, “The experience of seeing an artwork virtually and seeing it in real is very different. The gallery is a very quiet space and that creates an experience. Also, the artworks in reality are actually very huge and majestic.”

Other than paintings, there is an art wall for students to express themselves and leave comments and thoughts after their visit. The art wall will be left behind for the school when the truck leaves for another destination. 

Head of Aesthetics Miss Lim Hwee Tin felt that this exposure is just the tip of an iceberg and she hopes this experience would spark the interest in art for students and open the doors to more art activities.

**_Primary 2 Art-in-Transit_**      
The Art-in-Transit programme provides our students with learning experiences beyond the classrooms, exposing them to the art installations in the MRT stations and providing insight into the history of the community in which the stations are located.   Besides art appreciation, the infusion of English and Mathematics activities through the artworks allows our students to learn English and Mathematics in authentic and meaningful context, thereby enabling them to see the interconnectedness between the subjects.

**_Primary 4 Museum-based Learning_**    
The museum-based learning is a core learning experience for our P4 students. The museum provides an authentic context for the learning of local art, Singapore’s history and heritage. Through the pre-, during- and post-visit experiences, the students are involved as artists and audience to create and appreciate art.
