<h4>1. Homework Policy&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Homework Policy helps parents understand how homework is designed,
assigned, and managed to support their child's learning and overall development.
The policy aims to:</p>
<p><strong>Reinforce classroom learning through purposeful and meaningful assignments.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foster critical thinking, creativity, and self-directed learning skills
in students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote a healthy balance between academic work, personal interests, family
time, and well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure inclusivity by catering to diverse learning needs and readiness
levels through differentiated homework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish effective tracking and communication systems to promote consistency,
accountability, and collaboration among teachers, students, and parents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. General Guidelines</h4>
<p>Homework is designed to provide students with focused practice while maintaining
a healthy balance between academics and personal development. Emphasis
is placed on quality and consistency, rather than excessive or repetitive
tasks. By adhering to homework time guidelines, we ensure that students
benefit from meaningful and manageable assignments without feeling overwhelmed</p>

<p><u>2.3 Homework during Public Holidays</u>
</p>
<p>To give students a break from formal learning and allow them to spend
quality time with their families, no homework will be assigned during public
holidays.</p>
<h4>3. Role of Students</h4>
<p>To maximise their homework and learning experience, students should cultivate
&nbsp;good habits and take responsibility for their assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Students can develop effective homework habits by adhering to the following responsibilities:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Record all assignments from the Homework Board in the Student Handbook
for easy reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure they understand each task and seek help if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete all homework with quality and submit it on time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review teacher feedback, make corrections, and learn from mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish and follow a home study timetable to manage time effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Role of Parents</h4>
<p>Parents play a vital role in supporting their child’s learning and homework
routine. By creating a positive home environment for studying, setting
expectations, and maintaining open communication with teachers, parents
can help their child develop good habits, manage time effectively, and
foster a love for learning.</p>
<p><strong>Parents can support their children’s learning by:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Checking the Student Handbook for homework assignments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging quality work and monitoring homework progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring all assignments are completed on time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guiding them to set a regular study time and develop good study habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicating with teachers about their child’s progress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
