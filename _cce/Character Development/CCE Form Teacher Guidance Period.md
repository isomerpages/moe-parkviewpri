<p>As form teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, time is allocated on Mondays for form teachers to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Provide quality interaction time between form teachers and pupils, and</p></li><li><p>Equip pupils with social and emotional competencies.</p></li></ul><p>The allocated one period for lower primary and two periods for upper primary per week carves out time for more quality teacher-pupil interaction and allows teachers to equip pupils with social and emotional competencies.</p><p>Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is explicitly taught during CCE (FTGP). Form Teachers conduct explicit teaching of Social and Emotional competencies to equip pupils with self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship management and responsible decision-making skills. In addition, Form Teachers bond with pupils through interaction activities within the period. The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons also help strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships.</p><p>Lessons on Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) and protection from abuse have been incorporated CCE(FTGP) lessons to address specific issues and reinforce the core values and social and emotional competencies to enable pupils to apply them to the specific contexts.</p><p>At PVPS, we also believe in the active partnership between school and home when what is taught and learnt in school is reinforced at home. Parents can refer to “Family Time” in the CCE (FTGP) lessons which provide suggestions for activities which allow parents to bond with their children and support their children’s development.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Curriculum/CCE FTGP/Picture1.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Curriculum/CCE FTGP/Picture2.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Curriculum/CCE FTGP/Picture3.png"></div><p></p>
