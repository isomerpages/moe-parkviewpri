### Mathematics Framework

![](/images/Math_FW.jpg)

The teaching and learning of mathematics aims primarily to equip pupils with a firm foundation of knowledge and skills in mathematics. The central focus of our mathematics framework is problem solving, which is supported by five interrelated dimensions: concepts, skills, processes, attitudes and metacognition. Excellence in mathematics anchors in problem solving, and through problem solving, pupils are developed into thinkers and problem solvers, who are independent, engaged, creative and critical.

To achieve our vision, our approach is Delivery, Interest, Application and Assessment (DIAA). The four approaches play specific roles to realize our desired outcomes:  

*   Cultivate and enhance pupils’ interest to keep them connected, motivated and driven in problem solving.
*   Equip pupils with a strong foundation in concepts, skills, thinking process and metacognition through various effective instructional programmes, pedagogy and learning experiences.
*   Provide opportunity and exposure for pupils to use and apply mathematics in challenging tasks, non-routine questions, investigations and real life problem.
*   Adopt a holistic approach to assessment to facilitate effective instructional planning and to account for pupils’ progress and support their learning.

<h3>STAR<a name="STAR"></a></h3>

The Mathematics department adopts the STAR approach, a 4-phased structured process, to help our students in developing problem-solving ability and confidence in solving real-world problems. The approach employs the use of George Polya’s problem solving technique and Edward de Bono’s Six Thinking Hats to expand a systematic flow to approach a problem.

<h3>ENRICHMENT<a name="ENRICHMENT"></a></h3>

<h4>E2K Programme</h4>

<h5>TARGET GROUP</h5>

Selected Primary 4 to Primary 5 pupils with high ability in Mathematics.

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

The E2K Mathematics Programme is a Mathematics enrichment programme for Primary 4 and Primary 5 students in Park View Primary School who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in students mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematics explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

  

### Financial Literacy Programme

Park View Primary School embarked on the whole-school Financial Literacy Programme by the Math Department to educate our pupils on the importance of money management.

The objective is to equip our pupils with the relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes/ values to cope with the financial landscape of the 21st century.

### Activity-Based Learning

In activity-based lessons, pupils are involved in experiential learning through hands-on activities. Pupils learn to work together in groups, involve in meaningful discussions, helping one another in discovering the answers and accepting each other’s strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, the teachers play the role of facilitator, observer, listener and guiding pupils in the problem solving activities.

Since pupils work in small groups, pupils tend to be less shy and they are usually willing to make mistakes. They take responsibility of their own learning through group discussions.

Activity-based lesson is one of the strategies to instil passion and interest in all pupils in the learning of mathematical problem solving. It encourages pupils to apply what they have learnt, through the activities they carry out, many of which usually relate to real life situation. Activity based lessons provide pupils with platform to stay engaged and learn creatively. Pupils take responsibility in their learning actively rather than passive receivers of information and knowledge.  

This is in line with the Mathematics Department Vision: Every Park View pupil is an independent and engaged problem solver, and a creative and critical thinker, who strives for excellence.

### P4 to P6 Mathematics Olympiad Training

  

The focus of the training is to:

  

*   Engage pupils in thinking activities by discussing and solving non-routine problems;
*   Equip pupils with the necessary problem solving skills and mathematical knowledge for higher order problem solving
*   stimulate pupils’ interest and enthusiasm for problem solving;
*   introduce pupils to the process, thinking skills and techniques that are required to solve Math Olympiad-like non-routine problems and
*   instil in pupils the spirit of learning by discovery

Through the training sessions, pupils experience the satisfaction, pleasure, fun and thrill of discovery associated with creative problem solving.

The topics covered at the various levels are as follow:

### P3 and P4 Mathematics Investigative Task

Math Investigative Tasks (MIT) is a package which integrates some elements of Mathematical Modelling Mathematical Modelling is the abstract representation of an object or system using mathematical concepts such as number, quantity, shape, variability, etc. The main purpose is to create meaningful learning of Mathematics for pupils. It is a mean that links between real-world experiences and abstract mathematical representation. In addition, the processes during the Mathematical Modelling involve students in use of mathematical discourse such as explaining, describing, exploring, conjecturing, predicting, justifying, resolving conflict and revising solution..

Pupils are exposed to non-routine and open-ended tasks where they are taught to articulate their thinking processes before coming to a decision. In this package, pupils will be able to

*   Identify the links between real-world experiences and mathematical concepts;

*   articulate their thinking and reasoning process and improve on their decision making skills using mathematical concepts and

*   work synergistically as a team to solve a problem and showcase their presentation skills.

  

In MIT, teachers act as facilitators throughout the process, such as providing the right amount of scaffolding for students and creating the right climate for self or peer critique of work using task-specific rubrics.

  

_Example of an MIT question:_

Mr Lim received a ticket for the Night Safari which has a total of 6 different enclosures. However, due to the time constraint, he can only visit 3 enclosures.

(a) In how many ways can he choose to visit 3 different enclosures?

(b) What pattern do you observe?

  
  

### Math@Home Package

As part of the school’s efforts to encourage parents to take on a more active role in supporting their child’s learning, the Math department has designed a Mathematics booklet (i.e. Math@Home) to get parents involved in their child's learning of Math.

The ‘Math@Home Booklet for Parents’ is designed and prepared for P1 to P3 pupils as these are the levels where basic mathematical knowledge are mostly introduced.

Questions set are in accordance to the objectives stated in the textbooks that pupils use. It is hoped that through this package, pupils will gradually be able to cope better when they progress to the next levels. With more successes experienced at a younger age, pupils’ level of confidence and motivation will thus be enhanced.

**Aims of the Math@Home Package**

*   Work in partnership with parents to enhance pupils’ learning of Mathematics.
*   Guide parents in reinforcing mathematical concepts with their child and to supervise their child in taking the topical test in the booklet at home.
*   Develop positive learning environment at home.
*   Motivate pupils to learn Mathematics and develop positive attitudes towards Mathematics.
