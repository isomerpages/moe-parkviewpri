# **Mother Tongue**

In Park View Primary School, we would like to nurture students to be confident user and lifelong learners of the Mother Tongue language.

The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Teaching and Learning Framework guides the department in setting a direction and structure in its teaching learning of the Mother Tongue Language, in alignment with the school’s vision and mission.


### Teaching and Learning Framework

The acquisition of language skills to as high a level as the student is able to, forms the core of the Mother Tongue Department’s Teaching and Learning Framework.


### Approach

A 3-prong approach – Support, Enrich and Stretch is adopted in achieving this goal.
