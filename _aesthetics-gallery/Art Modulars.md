### Modular Art

**_P6 Modular Art: Triangle Canvas Mural_**

In this programme, the students discuss and appreciate the artworks of local and international artworks and artists such as Anthony Poon, Jackson Pollock and Wassily Kandinsky. They create artworks in pairs and groups of threes using the artists’ artworks and the environment as sources of inspiration.

The programme takes the Primary 6 students through the basics of the making of a mural through the design, fabrication and the refinement phase of the Art form. They revisit the elements of art and principle of designs through the hands-on lessons.
