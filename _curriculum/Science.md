#### Resources
##### Science Wall
<p align="justify">
Our Science wall reflects how the three main human systems in our body, Digestive System, Circulatory System and Respiratory System, work together to ensure our body can function properly with the help of energy. There is a detailed explanation with key concepts of how each human system works. The extensive graphics also provide better understanding of the concepts for visual learners. Each human system is also accompanied by an interactive activity.</p>

##### Science Garden
<p align="justify">
For pupils to have meaningful learning in science, it is important that they be allowed to experience the process of seeking answers to problems. This requires pupils to physically explore and discover knowledge, be it within their environment or in a laboratory. Besides having two indoor science laboratories, the Science Department has recently created an integrated learning trail weaving through the open spaces in the school.</p>

<p align="justify">There are different thematic gardens simulating various natural environments.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Blooms@Energy Hub</b> is a floral garden characterized by an explosion of colours and fragrances. It comprises a flowering and butterfly garden.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Food@ Energy Hub</b> has a herbs and spices garden and a mini vegetable plot with local fruit trees planted around the school.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Desert@Energy Hub</b> located at the back of the school building houses desert flora with a variety of cactus.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Rainforest@Energy Hub</b> showcases a slice of a tropical rainforest complete with a fernery garden and an eco-pond surrounded by lush tropical vegetation. A leaf litter habitat is also set up in the fernery garden for pupils to have first-hand experience in studying the conditions of a leaf litter habitat.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>The Energy Pavilion</b> is an outdoor classroom amid the shrubs and creepers. It is a place where teachers can carry out their lessons or briefing before adjourning to the gardens for practical sessions.</p>

<p align="justify">With the launch of the different “Hubs”, pupils can now just make a short trip down to see the plants that they study about in their books. This hands-on experience allows them to understand their lessons better. It is always good to be near Mother Nature.</p>

#### Learning Journey to Singapore Science Centre

<p align="justify">
P1 to P5 students will go on a learning journey to the Singapore Science Centre every year to attend practical laboratory session or lecture demonstration on the topics that they learn in their primary science education. The Science Centre enrichment programmes complement the school science curriculum with hands-on and inspiring learning experiences. The enrichment programmes aim to:</p>

<ul><li>provide students with experiences which build on their interest in and stimulate their curiosity about their environment</li>

<li>provide engaging and meaningful acquisition of scientific knowledge</li>

<li>inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry through the application of different process skills such as observing, comparing, classifying, analysing, inferring, evaluating and investigating.</li></ul>

<img src="/images/Curriculum/Science/Science_3.png" style="width:100%">

#### P6: Ecology Learning Journey & Coastal Cleanup

<p align="justify">P6 students will go on an Ecology Learning Journey to Pasir Ris Beach. The students will also get to experience a coastal clean-up at the beach after exploring the mudflat and mangrove swamp.</p>

The objectives of the learning journey are to:

<ul><li>Increase students’ awareness of the ecosystem of the seashore community in Singapore</li>

<li>Learn about the diversity of life on the seashore and selected animals and plants’ adaptations to life on the seashore</li>

<li>Relate and extend students’ Science knowledge to real life experiences so as to provide them with a deeper understanding about life around them</li>

<li>Integrate a meaningful Community Involvement Project (CIP) where students take meaningful actions to protect the environment.</li></ul>

<img src="/images/Curriculum/Science/Science_4.png" style="width:100%">

#### P6: P4 & P5 Science Olympiad Training 

<p align="justify">P4 and P5 students are selected to participate in Science Olympiad training.</p>

The objectives of the programme are as follows:

<ul><li>To develop students' interest, creativity, analytical thinking skill, spirit of learning through discovery and challenge in Science

<li>To expose students’ with secondary science syllabus in attempt to broaden their knowledge of Science

<li>To prepare selected students for Primary Science Olympiad competitions.</li></ul>

<p align="justify">The training sessions are based on the broad science themes in the elementary science curriculum. These lessons focused on introducing Physics, Chemistry and Biology to students as well as to enhance their general knowledge.</p>

<p align="justify">Selected P5 students may have the opportunity to participate in the Raffles Science Olympiad Competition (RSO) or the NUS High Singapore Primary Science Olympiad (SPSO).</p>

<img src="/images/Curriculum/Science/Science_5.png" style="width:100%">

#### P4 and P5 Science E2K Programme

<p align="justify">P4 and P5 students are selected to participate in the Science E2K programme.</p>

The objectives of the programme are as follows:

<ul><li>To develop scientific inquiry process skills among primary students in Science</li>

<li>To acquire habits, attitudes and dispositions of scientists</li>

<li>To nurture other 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective and communication skills</li></ul>

<p align="justify">The E2K Science Programme is a science enrichment programme for upper primary students who demonstrate interest and ability in science. The programme is adapted from Israel’s E2K Programme which is developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE).</p>

<p align="justify">The lessons are based on the broad science themes in the elementary science curriculum. The students will collect and use evidence to address scientifically oriented questions, formulate explanations from evidence to address the questions and evaluate their explanations.</p>

<img src="/images/Curriculum/Science/Science_6.png" style="width:100%">

#### P6 DNA Science Enrichment Programme

<p align="justify">In this programme, selected P6 studdents are provided the opportunity to conduct simulated forensic investigation activities where DNA is analysed as evidence. Through such hands-on activities, students get to extend the learning of scientific investigation skills outside classroom setting for scientific inquiry. In doing so, it is hoped that they are able to relate their Science knowledge to real life experiences so as to provide them with a deeper understanding about life around them.</p>

The objectives of the programme are as follows:

<ul><li>Introduction to laboratory techniques

<li>Introduction to chromatography to separate components in an ink mixture

<li>Using of apparatus in the extraction of solutes

<li>Analyse blood stains & understand how blood stains are used to solve mystery.</li></ul>

#### P3 Budding Scientists Programme

<p align="justify">The Budding Scientists Programme is a new enrichment programme planned for our P3 students. With the main aim of enabling our beginning Science learners to transit seamlessly into their journey of learning Science, the Department members came together to pool our experiences and resources into planning an in-house enrichment programme for our young charges.</p>

The objectives of the programme are as follows:

<ul><li>To develop students’ interest and creativity, through discovery and hands-on experiments in Science;
<li>To learn through inquiry to clarify misconceptions in Science;
<li>To broaden their knowledge of Science and create awareness of the natural phenomenon in the world.</li></ul>

<p align="justify">Our P3s were highly enthused and thoroughly enjoyed the activities planned for them. From the enriching experience, they can have a better grasp of how Scientists conduct experiments, as they learnt how to go about designing and conducting a fair experiment.</p>
