<p>As part of the CCE level outcome of ‘Active citizens who have pride in nation building’, our P5 pupils played their part in contributing to the community through the yearly visits to Kheng Chiu Happy Lodge and Jamiyah Home. Pupils went through the ‘LOVE’ package entitled ‘One Love Many Lives’ where they went through a structured approachas part of the VIA cycle – pre VIA, actual VIA and post VIA..</p><p>Before the VIA, the ‘L’ approach was used. Pupils become aware of the lives of the elderly and the reasons they are in a home. The ‘O’ approach provided the opportunity for our pupils to take the initiative and plan their own activities for the VIA. For the actual VIA, our pupils engaged the elderly through craft and games. The elderly enjoyed traditional games such as congkak, five stones, board games and shooting the Nerf guns. The elderly even participated enthusiastically in ball games too! As for craft, the elderly were engrossed in colouring and making useful items using coloured ice cream sticks. Some of our pupils also got the chance to serve tea break to a group of elderly!</p><p>Upon returning from their VIA, pupils continued with the ‘V’ and ‘E’ approach where they reflected and blogged about values, skills and experiences that they have learnt through the VIA preparation and visit. Through the ‘E’ approach, they reflect on their emotions using the Mirror - Microscope-Binoculars tool and extend their learning beyond school to home.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/P5%20Via.jpg"></div><p><strong>Our Primary 5 pupils learnt to:</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>recognize that everyone has the ability to help others in our community who face difficulties in their lives</p></li><li><p>share and put others before self</p></li><li><p>show empathy and care towards others</p></li></ul><p></p>
