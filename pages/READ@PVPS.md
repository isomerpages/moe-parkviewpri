<p>At PVPS, we believe that our students’ love and joy for reading should
    be developed using fun and engaging ways.</p>

    students to read widely and complete fun and interesting activities related
    to the books they are reading!</p>

<p>Library Fiesta is an annual school event organised by the Library Committee
    and English Department for students. The main objective of Library Fiesta
    is to promote the love for reading. Level competitions such as bookmark
    making, advertisement design and book cover design were organised during
    the Library Fiesta to promote and generate interest in reading, as well
    as to celebrate and showcase students’ proficiency in the English Language.</p>
<p>We believe that reading takes you to places and in 2023, we took our students
    “Around the World”! The Library Fiesta week began with our much-anticipated
    Character Day and our school was populated with many colourful book characters
    from all over the world.</p>

<p>Our Reading Nook was officially launched near the canteen, where students
    can enjoy reading a book or even take the stage to share about their favorite
    books with their schoolmates during recess.</p>

    Mount Emily series, to share how she gets her ideas for her books with
    our students.</p>
