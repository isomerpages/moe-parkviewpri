<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Park View Primary School Hockey was started in 2001. We have taken part
in the National Inter-Primary Schools Hockey Tournament every year. We
have a team of committed and dedicated teachers who supervise them during
training sessions and bring them out for tournaments. We look forward to
achieving awards and scale to greater heights in the coming years.</p>
<h4>Training Programme</h4>
<p>The training emphasizes on skill development of players when they join
at Primary 3 where they are groomed by the coach to prepare them to be
part of the school team. Selected players in Primary 4-6 will take part
in National School Games (NSG) Hockey Championships .</p>
