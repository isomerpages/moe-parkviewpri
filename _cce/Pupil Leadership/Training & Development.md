# **Training & Development**

To maximise the effectiveness of our Pupil Leadership Development Programme, different training and programmes are designed for each of the 3 approaches.

**Leadership for All**

All P1 to P6 pupils in PVPS will undergo the General Level Pupil Leadership Training which will allow a progressive development of leadership skills and qualities in pupils. In order to provide leadership opportunities for all pupils, the Class Committee Leadership (CCL) programme is put in place. The focus is on classroom responsibilities.

Under the CCL, every pupil is given the opportunity to be a class committee leader at least once a year. Pupils are rotated once a term or semester.

  

The various leadership positions under the CCL are:

| Primary 1 - 3 	| Primary 4 - 6 	|
|---	|---	|
| Monitor 	| Monitor 	|
| Assistant Monitor 	| Assistant Monitor 	|
| Group Leaders 	| Group Leaders 	|
| Assistant Group Leaders 	| Assistant Group Leaders 	|
| Cleanliness Leaders 	| Cleanliness Leaders 	|
| Environment Leaders 	| Environment Leaders 	|
| PE Monitors 	| Subject Leaders 	|
|  	| PE Monitors 	|
|  	| ICT Leaders 	|


Differentiated training for P1 - P6 pupils are conducted by the respective level teachers every term. This is to ensure that pupils are clear of their expected roles and responsibilities at the beginning of every rotation. It is also to equip them with the necessary skills to perform their respective roles and pre-empt the possible challenges that may arise.

  

  

**Leadership for Service Learning Council**

  

In order to provide opportunities for pupils to apply their leadership skills and qualities at a higher level, the school has created 7 Service Learning Councils for pupils to serve the school. Pupils who show leadership potential will be appointed as Service Learning Council Leaders. They will get to experience assuming a leadership position in the school-level while serving the school. These students will champion certain causes or focus areas depending on which of the 7 Service Councils they are in. (E.g. Green Ambassadors will lead the school in the area of environmental awareness, Cyber Wellness Ambassadors will lead the school in promoting cyberwellness.)

The various leadership positions under the SLC are:

1) Aesthetics Ambassadors;
2) Cyber Wellness Ambassadors;

3) Green Ambassadors;

4) HoPE Ambassadors;

5) NE Ambassadors or

6) MRL Ambassadors

7) Prefects

From 2014, SLC conducted in-house Leadership training using the SLC Leader's Handbook (The Leader in Me) to develop personal leadership, people leadership and public leadership skills.

**Leadership for Key Leaders**

  

Pupils in the above Service Learning Councils who have been identified as having excellent leadership skills and qualities will be selected to be Key Leaders. They are considered the cream of the crop in the domain of leadership and are role models for the whole school. They lead the school in behaving in line with the schoolâ€™s shared values.

  

The Key Leaders take on more responsibilities than those in the Service Learning Council. They will assume key leadership positions to head their respective Service Learning Councils and work with the Service Learning Council Leaders in leading the school. Besides leading the school in school initiatives and promoting causes, platforms will be given to them to lead in organizing school functions and events. In addition to contributing to the school, opportunities will be given to Key Leaders to contribute to the community and society (e.g. Special VIA projects).
