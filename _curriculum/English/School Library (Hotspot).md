<h4>PVPS Reading Passport</h4>

This passport integrates the skills of the 21st century – Information Literacy and Social Emotional that encompass the core subjects of English and the language arts.</p>

It encompasses termly reading activities that ties in with the termly thematic programmes in the library. Students collect stamps after completing the activities. These stamps can be exchanged for positive benefits and a HAF certificate at the end of the year.</p>
