<h4>Dear Parents,</h4>
<p>The PSG functions on the fundamental belief that each and every parent
plays an important part in nurturing the future of our children, and in
turn our nation, by working closely with the school to provide holistic
education for our pupils. The PSG in Park View Primary School works in
close collaboration with the School Leaders and teachers and supports them
by ensuring that all programmes and activities designed are executed as
efficiently as possible, so that our pupils can maximize their learning
and enjoy their experiences from these programmes, hence enriching their
schooling journey. In order to support the diverse and widespread range
of activities, we are constantly looking for more parents to join the PSG
and provide the school a helping hand.</p>
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to our family. Please
come and join us and be a part of this marvellous journey with your child.
Watch them grow and bloom into bright, confident, independent individuals
and see the pride in their eyes knowing you were part of it. We believe
that each and every parent has the power and ability to contribute and
no contribution is too little. Through teamwork, Together Everyone Achieves
More.</p>

<h4>Our Budding Chef Programme</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BuddingChefmain.jpg">
</div>
<p>Helmed by our school’s Parent Support Group (PSG),Our Budding Chef Programme
is an innovative Home Economics programme held during curriculum time.
It seeks to provide a fun learning experience for our Pri 1 and 2 pupils.</p>
<p>The PSG co-created and designed the curriculum of the programme. In preparation
of the lessons, the parents discussed lesson pedagogies and conducted trial
cooking sessions. They also organised and participated in a video production
where they demonstrated and explained the procedures of cooking as well
as safety and hygiene in the kitchen. The videos are shown to the pupils
before each hands-on session as a form of tuning-in.</p>
<p>While these pupils enjoy a hands-on experience of whipping up simple dishes,
they are accessing the various learning domains such as cognitive (English,
Math and Science), social (dining etiquette and collaborative skills) and
physical (Health Education), and critical thinking skills in every lesson.
This programme gives pupils an authentic feel of the topics that they learn
in school.</p>
<p>Pupils undergo a five-week programme where each lesson starts with an
introduction of recipes, video demonstration of the dishes and thematic
teaching of explicit skills such as safety in the kitchen. During the lesson,
pupils experience cutting and preparation of ingredients and cooking. These
help them develop their psychomotor skills and make them understand the
characteristics of the food they handle. After the hands-on activity, pupils
are taken through a process of reflection to help them internalise the
lessons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I enjoyed&nbsp;_Our Budding Chef Programme_&nbsp;because the programme
has taught me to take care of my health through healthy eating. I learned
that action words related to cooking such as 'cut' and 'cook' are called
verbs. I also know how to measure the mass of the ingredients using a weighing
scale and handle a knife safely and responsibly in the kitchen," Bizard
Oscar of Pri 2A shared.</p>
<p>“As a parent volunteer in charge of this programme, I get to set the learning
objectives with the school. We designed this programme to teach our pupils
how to apply what they have learnt in class. It is a joy seeing how pupils
can take personal responsibility of their well-being,” Mdm Sandy Ang, a
PSG member, shared.</p>
<p>Our parent volunteers noticed that their children are now more aware of
the importance of healthy eating and the nutritional value of food after
undergoing this programme. They are pleased that their children are now
more willing to eat vegetables and fruits than before. Besides that, their
children now request to help out in the kitchen. Most importantly, pupils
take learning out of the classroom and are able to see the relevance and
authenticity of what they learn in the classroom. The best testimony of
the success of the programme is the high level of engagement of our pupils
as many of them look forward excitedly to their next lesson.</p>
