<p align="justify">The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in PVPS, Innovation through Service and Leadership (iSL) focuses on the area of innovation and enterprise. The ALP, part of the Park View Experience, aims to educate students to demonstrate school values and 21CC and connect them to real life experiences as these form the important core of student development. It also aims to develop the sense of purpose and a growth mindset which students can apply to real life problem-solving that will help them to have the sense of agency to be future-ready and to be an active contributor to the society. Our ALP gives opportunities for all students to develop innovation skills at various levels of challenges to empower them to grow in confidence and competence mainly through the design thinking process.</p>
