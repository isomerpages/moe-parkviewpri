**Leadership for All (Exposure)**

  

*   The main focus of “Leadership for All” is to give leadership exposure to all students.

  

**Leadership for Service Learning Council (Experience)**

  

*   The main focus of “Leadership for Service Learning Council” is to allow students to experience taking up leadership roles and the responsibilities and challenges that come with these roles while serving the school.

*   This is targeted at students who have demonstrated school shared values and display leadership potential.

*   The 7 Service Learning Councils are:

	*   Aesthetics Ambassadors
	*   Cyberwellness Ambassadors
	*   Green Ambassadors
	*   HoPE Ambassadors
	*   MRL Ambassadors
