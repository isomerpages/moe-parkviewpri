# **Art Appreciation**

### Art Outreach

**Community Outreach Programme through Recycled Art**

Art Club members, in collaboration with the Green Ambassadors, carry out the yearly Community Outreach Programme through Recycled Art by reaching out to the kindergarten pupils to share with them the importance of environment conservation and how they can do their part to protect mother Earth.

Through simple craftwork, the Art Club members teach the kindergarten pupils how to transform common household trash such as toilet rolls, bottle caps and plastic bottles into useful craftwork such as pencil holders and coin banks.

This programme is also a platform to develop the social and emotional competencies of our pupils and an opportunity for them to hone their leadership skills.

**Primary 2 Art Outreach Programme**

Park View Primary School, in collaboration with our parent volunteers and Art Outreach; a non-profit organisation which provides art education for the public, provide a monthly art appreciation lesson to our Primary Two pupils.

The monthly training session for our parent volunteers encompasses both art content training and presentation skills training, and it provides the following knowledge:

*   Artistic influences and concepts;
*   Social and historical context of the art; and
*   Suggested ways to make the art come alive for pupils.

**Primary 2 Art-in-Transit Learning Journey**

The Art-in-Transit programme provides our pupils with learning experiences beyond the classrooms, exposing them to the art installations in the MRT stations and providing insight into the history of the community in which the stations are located.

Besides art appreciation, the infusion of English and Mathematics activities through the artworks allows our pupils to learn English and Mathematics in authentic and meaningful context, thereby enabling them to see the interconnectedness between the subjects.
