# **Outdoor Education Module**

### A synopsis of PAL Outdoor Education
In this module, students learn to observe how plants grow and develop a lively curiosity about how nature brings colour and variety to the environment. Basic outdoor skills are also being developed, like preparing for outdoor trips and how to deal with creatures and plants in our environment.
They are taken on outdoor trips which are slightly different from the usual learning journeys. These learning activities are designed to challenge students to move out of their comfort zone to the natural environment to enable the appreciation and love for nature. At the end of every lesson, time will be set aside for the students to express and reflect on their learning experiences.
