<b>P1 & P2 Wushu Enrichment Programme</b>

Wushu Enrichment is a programme customised for P1 and P2 pupils. It aims to introduce our pupils to basic martial arts through engaging lessons. Throughout the programme, emphasis will be placed on hand and leg movements and coordination. Pupils will then be able to perform a basic routine.

The programme also seeks to inculcate values of Respect, Discipline and Perseverance in the pupils. Pupils reap the benefits of improved focus and better conduct. Our Parent Support Group partners the school in facilitating the values education segment together with the Wushu coaches during lessons.

During the camps, pupils learn useful skills such as topography, tent-pitching and conflict management. They also have the opportunities to take part in activities such as dragon boating, Challenge Ropes Course and team-building games. Through adventure challenges and activities, pupils get to:

*   Overcome their fears and limitations
*   Challenge themselves
*   Grow in confidence and self-esteem
*   Step outside their comfort zone
*   Develop an appreciation for nature
*   Manage risk and learn to reflect
*   Develop team-building and leadership skills
