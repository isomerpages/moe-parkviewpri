<h4>A synopsis of PAL Visual Arts</h4>
<p>Visual arts is one of the 3 domains of PAL and it focuses on ‘Doodling’.
The aim is to provide students with the opportunity to experience the creativity
and imagination involved in the world of cartooning and doodling. Through
this module, students have the chance to discover their aptitude and interests,
develop their confidence and creativity and hone their drawing and colouring
skills through fun learning activities. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)
is also incorporated in every PAL lesson to promote positive social and
emotional development in the students.</p>
<h4>Primary 1</h4>

<p>The Primary 1 students will be introduced to the basics of doodling and
squiggling and the different types of lines, shapes and patterns. They
will learn the correct techniques of colouring and colour blends. In addition,
students will squiggle, doodle and have fun learning about animals and
their characteristics. They will also work as a team to freely expressed
and create animal doodles based on a squiggle.</p>

<h5><u>Gallery E-Book</u></h5>
<p>The objective of the eBook project was to showcase pupils’ group work
digitally. The eBook project captured the creative abilities and imagination
of our pupils. Pupils were challenged to create scenes (story segment)
from 7 fairy tales. Each fairy tale is broken into 6 scenes and pupils
worked closely in groups of 5 to express their ideas based on the fairy
tale that the group had been assigned.</p>
<p>The pupils had read the story before generating ideas for the illustrations.
Two P2 pupils were selected to record the eBook stories on 20/4/2010. The
completed works were uploaded into an eBook using the Koolbits software
As part of the school’s efforts to nurture talents, 13 pupil talents were
identified to work with the trainers on 04/5/2010 to recreate a set of
illustrations for the book “Little Red Riding Hood”. They were challenged
to illustrate the story scenes based on random squiggles drawn by the trainers.
Their creative works were shared with the teachers and the pupils. The
eBook is also used as a resource for the school’s reading programme, which
caters to weak readers in the lower primary Since 2010, we have moved on
and created many interesting eBook stories with our pupils based on different
SEL values. Please find out more from our Visual Arts Modules.</p>
