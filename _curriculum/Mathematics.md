<p>The teaching and learning of mathematics aims primarily to equip students
with a firm foundation of knowledge and skills in mathematics. The central
focus of our mathematics framework is problem solving, which is supported
by five interrelated dimensions: concepts, skills, processes, attitudes
and metacognition. Excellence in mathematics anchors in problem solving,
and through problem solving, students are developed into thinkers and problem
solvers, who are independent, engaged, creative and critical.</p>
<p>To achieve our vision, our approach is Delivery, Interest, Application
and Assessment (DIAA). The four approaches play specific roles to realize
our desired outcomes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cultivate and enhance students' interest to keep them connected, motivated
and driven in problem solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equip students with a strong foundation in concepts, skills, thinking
process and metacognition through various effective instructional programmes,
pedagogy and learning experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunity and exposure for students to use and apply mathematics
in challenging tasks, non-routine questions, investigations and real life
problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt a holistic approach to assessment to facilitate effective instructional
planning and to account for students’ progress and support their learning.</p>

<h4>STAR</h4>
<p>The Mathematics department adopts the STAR approach, a 4-phased structured
process, to help our students in developing problem-solving ability and
confidence in solving real-world problems. The approach employs the use
of George Polya’s problem solving technique and Edward de Bono’s Six Thinking
Hats to expand a systematic flow to approach a problem.</p>

<h4>Enrichment</h4>
<h4>E2K Programme</h4>
<p><strong>TARGET GROUP</strong>
</p>
<p>Selected Primary 4 to Primary 5 students with high ability in Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme is a Mathematics enrichment programme for
Primary 4 and Primary 5 students in Park View Primary School who demonstrate
interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in students mathematical
reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry
approach. Students will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers
and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles,
games and mathematics explorations which are specially designed for the
programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve
to help students to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians
possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as
critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<h4>Financial Literacy Programme</h4>
<p>Park View Primary School embarked on the whole-school Financial Literacy
Programme by the Math Department to educate our students on the importance
of money management.</p>
<p>The objective is to equip our students with the relevant knowledge, skills
and attitudes/ values to cope with the financial landscape of the 21st
century.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/collage2.jpg">
</div>
<h4>Activity-Based Learning</h4>
<p>In activity-based lessons, students are involved in experiential learning
through hands-on activities. Students learn to work together in groups,
involve in meaningful discussions, helping one another in discovering the
answers and accepting each other’s strengths and weaknesses. On the other
hand, the teachers play the role of facilitator, observer, listener and
guiding students in the problem solving activities.</p>
<p>Since students work in small groups, pupils tend to be less shy and they
are usually willing to make mistakes. They take responsibility of their
own learning through group discussions.</p>
<p>Activity-based lesson is one of the strategies to instil passion and interest
in all students in the learning of mathematical problem solving. It encourages
pupils to apply what they have learnt, through the activities they carry
out, many of which usually relate to real life situation. Activity based
lessons provide students with platform to stay engaged and learn creatively.
Students take responsibility in their learning actively rather than passive
receivers of information and knowledge.</p>
<p>This is in line with the Mathematics Department Vision: Every Park View
student is an independent and engaged problem solver, and a creative and
critical thinker, who strives for excellence.</p>

<h4>P3 and P4 Mathematics Investigative Task</h4>
<p>Math Investigative Tasks (MIT) is a package which integrates some elements
of Mathematical Modelling Mathematical Modelling is the abstract representation
of an object or system using mathematical concepts such as number, quantity,
shape, variability, etc. The main purpose is to create meaningful learning
of Mathematics for pupils. It is a mean that links between real-world experiences
and abstract mathematical representation. In addition, the processes during
the Mathematical Modelling involve students in use of mathematical discourse
such as explaining, describing, exploring, conjecturing, predicting, justifying,
resolving conflict and revising solution.</p>
<p>Pupils are exposed to non-routine and open-ended tasks where they are
taught to articulate their thinking processes before coming to a decision.
In this package, pupils will be able to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Identify the links between real-world experiences and mathematical concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>articulate their thinking and reasoning process and improve on their decision
making skills using mathematical concepts and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work synergistically as a team to solve a problem and showcase their presentation
skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In MIT, teachers act as facilitators throughout the process, such as providing
the right amount of scaffolding for students and creating the right climate
for self or peer critique of work using task-specific rubrics.</p>
<p><strong><em>Example of an MIT question:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Lim received a ticket for the Night Safari which has a total of 6 different
enclosures. However, due to the time constraint, he can only visit 3 enclosures.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In how many ways can he choose to visit 3 different enclosures?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What pattern do you observe?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Math@Home Package</h4>
<p>As part of the school’s efforts to encourage parents to take on a more
active role in supporting their child’s learning, the Math department has
designed a Mathematics booklet (i.e. Math@Home) to get parents involved
in their child's learning of Math.</p>
<p>The ‘Math@Home Booklet for Parents’ is designed and prepared for P1 to
P3 pupils as these are the levels where basic mathematical knowledge are
mostly introduced.</p>
<p>Questions set are in accordance to the objectives stated in the textbooks
that pupils use. It is hoped that through this package, pupils will gradually
be able to cope better when they progress to the next levels. With more
successes experienced at a younger age, pupils’ level of confidence and
motivation will thus be enhanced.</p>
<p><strong>Aims of the Math@Home Package</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Work in partnership with parents to enhance pupils’ learning of Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide parents in reinforcing mathematical concepts with their child and
to supervise their child in taking the topical test in the booklet at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop positive learning environment at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motivate pupils to learn Mathematics and develop positive attitudes towards
Mathematics.</p>
