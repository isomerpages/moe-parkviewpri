**“Sir Stamford Raffles – The Founding of Singapore”**

![](/images/6D.jpg)

**Scene 1**: In the early part of the 1800s, the Dutch controlled most of the trade in the Malay Archipelago. This made it difficult for teh British and other Europeans to trade there. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles decided to look for another trading settlement somewhere at the southern end of the Straits of Melaka which was not controlled by the Dutch. Raffles set sail with a fleet of seven ships. On 28 January 1819, the ships sailed into the sea near the mouth of the Singapore River.
