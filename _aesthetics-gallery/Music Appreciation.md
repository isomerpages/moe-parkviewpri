# **Music Appreciation**

### PVPS Got Talents

**PVPS Got Talents**Â aims to provide talented pupils a platform to showcase their talents and also to cultivate audience and performers etiquette in the audience and performers respectively. Through the program, we have identified selected pupils to take part in external music competitions.

As the aesthetics department is constantly looking for new talents to sign up and perform. We highly encourage your child to take up the challenge to sign up for a performance during recess time. We look forward to having your child participate in our next PVPS Got Talent performance!
