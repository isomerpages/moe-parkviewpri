# **Young Nation Series**

**Young Nation Builder Card (YNBC) Programme (2007 – 2014)**  
  

The Young Nation Builder Card is Park View Primary School’s very own inaugural set of National Education (NE)/ Social Studies (SS) activity cards to let our pupils learn about NE and SS in a fun and engaging way. The school adopted a whole-school approach in promoting NE and SS through the use of the differentiated Young Nation Builder Cards for the respective levels.

In 2011, it was refined to another version which includes:  
\-    Alignment to Shared Values  
\-    Ownership of NE Message and  
\-    Use of ICT for learning  
  
  
**Young Nation Series (YNS) Programme (2015)**  
  

In 2014, the school decided that further refinements had to be made to align the YNBC to the changing CCE landscape and also to cater to our pupils’ learning needs. Focus group discussions were held with pupils, parents & teachers to gain insights on how we can further enhance the YNBC programme.

The revamped Young Nation Series (YNS) comprises of a series of 6 booklets. The key changes comprise of both curriculum and administrative changes:

**National Education Resources**  

In order to reinforce the importance of National Education (NE) and Social Studies (SS) amongst its pupils, Park View Primary school sought to make SS and NE more pervasive in the school by building a vibrant and lively school environment, steeped in NE and SS elements.
 

**Unravel Singapore Stamps**  

USS is a stamp display cabinet that showcases a wide array of stamps that are updated according to the events in the school calendar. Each stamp is accompanied by a write-up to explain its’ significance. While the lower primary will be involved in a quiz during recess, the upper primary will scan a QR code and answer the quiz via their smartphones or tablets.

The 2 storey corner has headings such as Currency, Famous Places, Famous Leaders, Costumes, Languages, Symbols and Food.

**Roundabout Singapore**  

As you walk or drive around our roundabout, you would notice metallic display boards flashing information on famous places and icons in Singapore. These fun facts are often read and enjoyed by our pupils who play around the roundabout during their recesses.

**Campaign Trail**  

The campaign trail begins from the school’s main gate and stretches along a covered walkway all the way to the school canteen. It showcases familiar and endearing campaign posters of the past. On display are a total of 10 large-sized campaign posters dating from 1977 to the early 1990s, each addressing different issues concerning Singapore at that time. Posters were used as they are powerful tools persuasion, and significant and familiar feature of Singaporean life.

**NE Corner**  

Our NE corner at level 3 brings pupils on a journey from the 1800s to the colonial times and finally to Modern Singapore. The timeline provides our pupils with the essential knowledge on the transformation of our nation. There are also traditional artefacts and games displayed at the corner. Pupils get a chance to mingle with their peers and play the games that their parents played while growing up. There is also a segment on ASEAN nations whereby pupils can learn about Singapore’s friends around the region.
