**To foster greater appreciation for the arts, students are introduced to different forms of arts through programmes like assembly performances and talks.**

#### <i>PVPS Got Talent</i>

PVPS Got Talent aims to provide talented students a platform to showcase their talents. It also aims to cultivate audience and performer etiquette in the audience and performers respectively. Through the programme, we have identified selected students to take part in external music competitions.

## Experience

Students learn best through hands-on participation in various performing arts. Through our modular music and dance activities, students are equipped with a sense of musicality, psychomotor skills, instrumental techniques and skills.

### <u>Music Modular Programmes</u>

#### <i>P1 – P4 Game based Activities</i>

Students learn music concepts while having fun! As students’ participation and motivation increase,&nbsp;they create positive experiences which lead to better learning retention.

#### <i>P3 and P4 Ukulele</i>

The ukulele has become increasingly popular in recent times because of its size and its unique sound. It is easier to learn and serves as a good stepping stone for students to learn the guitar at P5. As part of our broad-based arts approach, this programme is aimed at introducing students to the ukulele instrument. The module will give them a better understanding of the anatomy of the ukulele, the various chord progressions and using the instrument to express themselves through music. Through this module, we will build our students’ foundation in rhythm and their aural abilities.

Students celebrate their artistic efforts and achievements through Internal and external performances, competitions and events.&nbsp;

### 	<u>Events</u>

#### Celebrations through the Arts – Body Percussion

To cultivate life-long learning and connection to music, we infuse body percussion in many of our celebrations. Teachers and students across different levels interact and create music together. While being self-directed learners, students explore music-making with creative expressions.&nbsp;
