# **Art Appreciation**

### Art Outreach

**Community Outreach Programme through Recycled Art**

Art Club members, in collaboration with the Green Ambassadors, carry out the yearly Community Outreach Programme through Recycled Art by reaching out to the kindergarten pupils to share with them the importance of environment conservation and how they can do their part to protect mother Earth.

Through simple craftwork, the Art Club members teach the kindergarten pupils how to transform common household trash such as toilet rolls, bottle caps and plastic bottles into useful craftwork such as pencil holders and coin banks.

This programme is also a platform to develop the social and emotional competencies of our pupils and an opportunity for them to hone their leadership skills.

**Primary 2 Art Outreach Programme**

Park View Primary School, in collaboration with our parent volunteers and Art Outreach; a non-profit organisation which provides art education for the public, provide a monthly art appreciation lesson to our Primary Two pupils.

The monthly training session for our parent volunteers encompasses both art content training and presentation skills training, and it provides the following knowledge:

*   Artistic influences and concepts;
*   Social and historical context of the art; and
*   Suggested ways to make the art come alive for pupils.

**Primary 2 Art-in-Transit Learning Journey**

The Art-in-Transit programme provides our pupils with learning experiences beyond the classrooms, exposing them to the art installations in the MRT stations and providing insight into the history of the community in which the stations are located.

Besides art appreciation, the infusion of English and Mathematics activities through the artworks allows our pupils to learn English and Mathematics in authentic and meaningful context, thereby enabling them to see the interconnectedness between the subjects.

### Learning Journey

**P6 Learning Journey to Dragon Kiln**

The P6 pupils went on a learning journey to Thow Kwang Dragon Kiln Pottery Jungle situated at Lorong Tawas on 22 and 29 May 2014. It was their post-exam activity and also part of the school’s Aesthetics programme to expose pupils to the 3D art form and the rich heritage of the dragon kiln. During the tour, the pupils had the opportunity to view a variety of ceramic wares which showed the different cultures and styles of Asia. By participating in the walk-through in the dragon kiln and examining its interior, they gained a better understanding on how pottery was being stacked in a traditional wood fired kiln. Besides learning about the kiln’s history, construction and firing techniques, the pupils were also exposed to a studio pottery environment whereby they were given clay to create their own artworks. The intense concentration while working on the craft and the smiles on the faces were testimonies of a day well-spent. All in all, the experience was a fulfilling and memorable one for our P6 pupils.

To foster an appreciation of the arts, the school organises arts programme specially tailored to the level to create greater awareness of the different art forms and hone their skills as art explorers by learning to find clues in the artworks that reveal the who, when, where and what of the artworks.
