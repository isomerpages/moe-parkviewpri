# **Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

### PLAY@PARKVIEW OVERVIEW

![](/images/play_parkview.jpg)

Play@ParkView is Park View Primary's unique and exciting implementation of the Programme for Active Learning, or PAL. PAL is an initiative by the Ministry of Education to realise a more balanced curriculum and facilitate the well-rounded development of students. PAL provides children with opportunities for exposure to a broad range of activities so that they can discover their aptitudes and interests.

  

Play@ParkView is a non-academic programme built into the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students. Students will get to participate in the three domains: Visual Arts, Creative Movements, Sports & Games and Outdoor Education. Play @ Park View is designed in the form of fun modular learning activities where students will develop confidence and creativity, and be encouraged to explore and extend lessons learnt to their daily lives.
