<p>At PVPS, we believe that our students’ love and joy for reading should
be developed using fun and engaging ways.</p>

<p>Library Fiesta is an annual school event organised by the Library Committee
and English Department for students. The main objective of Library Fiesta
is to promote the love for reading. Level competitions such as bookmark
making, advertisement design and book cover design were organised during
the Library Fiesta to promote and generate interest in reading, as well
as to celebrate and showcase students’ proficiency in the English Language.</p>
<p>We believe that reading takes you to places and in 2023, we took our students
“Around the World”! The Library Fiesta week began with our much-anticipated
Character Day and our school was populated with many colourful book characters
from all over the world.</p>

<p>Our Reading Nook was officially launched near the canteen, where students
can enjoy reading a book or even take the stage to share about their favorite
books with their schoolmates during recess.</p>

<h4>2024 Author Visit: Darryl Kho @ Library Fiesta!</h4>
<p>As part of our Library Fiesta, we were thrilled to welcome award-winning
author <strong>Darryl Kho</strong> to our school for a special book talk
during assembly!</p>
<p>Darryl Kho, the brilliant mind behind "Mist-Bound: How to Glue Back Grandpa",
captivated our students with his heartfelt storytelling and insights into
the writing process. His debut novel, inspired by his own family’s experience
with dementia, explores themes of love, memory, and family through a magical
adventure — a story that resonated deeply with our audience.</p>
<p>During the session, students had the opportunity to hear about Darryl’s
journey as a writer, the inspiration behind his book, and the important
messages he hopes to share through his work. Many were inspired by how
he turned a personal family challenge into a touching and imaginative story
that has won multiple awards, including the Hedwig Anuar Children’s Book
Award.</p>
<p>We are grateful to Darryl Kho for taking the time to connect with our
young readers and spark a deeper appreciation for storytelling and empathy.</p>
<p>Keep a look out for our Author Visit this year!</p>
