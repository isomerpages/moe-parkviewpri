**Scene 1**: In the early part of the 1800s, the Dutch controlled most of the trade in the Malay Archipelago. This made it difficult for teh British and other Europeans to trade there. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles decided to look for another trading settlement somewhere at the southern end of the Straits of Melaka which was not controlled by the Dutch. Raffles set sail with a fleet of seven ships. On 28 January 1819, the ships sailed into the sea near the mouth of the Singapore River.

**Scene 2**: Soon after his ship had anchored, a group of people from the main island of Singapore came abroad. Raffles and his men learnt from them that Temenggong Abdil Rahman was in charge of the island. At that time, there was only a small Malay fishing village on yje island. The village was surrounded by the forests and swamps. Some Orang Laut and Chinese lived near the village.

**Scene 3**: On 29 Junuary 1819, Raffles and his assistant, Major William Farquhar, landed on the island of Singapore. Raffles was impressed with what he saw in Singapore. Singapore had a harbour with deep waters for big ships to call a port. there was plenty of fresh water so that ships could stop at the port for water before continuing their journeys and most importantly, Singapore was located on the main trade route between China and India.
