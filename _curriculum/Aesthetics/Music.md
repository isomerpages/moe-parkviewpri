<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p><strong>To foster greater appreciation for the arts, students are introduced to different forms of arts through programmes like assembly performances and talks.</strong>
</p>
<p><em>PVPS Got Talent</em>
</p>
<p>PVPS Got Talent aims to provide talented students a platform to showcase
their talents. It also aims to cultivate audience and performer etiquette
in the audience and performers respectively. Through the programme, we
have identified selected students to take part in external music competitions.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>Students learn best through hands-on participation in various performing
arts. Through our modular music and dance activities, students are equipped

and skills.</p>
<p><u>Music Modular Programmes</u>

<p><em>P3 and P4 Ukulele</em>
</p>
<p>The ukulele has become increasingly popular in recent times because of
its size and its unique sound. It is easier to learn and serves as a good
stepping stone for students to learn the guitar at P5. As part of our broad-based
arts approach, this programme is aimed at introducing students to the ukulele
instrument. The module will give them a better understanding of the anatomy
of the ukulele, the various chord progressions and using the instrument
to express themselves through music. Through this module, we will build
our students’ foundation in rhythm and their aural abilities.</p>
