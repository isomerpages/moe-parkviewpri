Our weekly drama activities during ELDDS sessions encompasses and integrates the elements of Drama and oral communication. We engage our students by involving them in decision making, problem solving and relationship management through theatrical hands on activities for their holistic development. This is achieved by creating avenues for them to communicate with others, devise their own creative pieces and work in an ensemble to perform for an audience.
  
The objective of the Club is to stimulate the young&nbsp;**curious**&nbsp;mind with imaginative activities enabling them to develop effective&nbsp;**communication**&nbsp;and interpersonal skills through drama activities such as role play and improvisation.

The learning process involves the ability to&nbsp;**collaborate**&nbsp;with team members, display empathy and tolerance for effective teamwork. It also helps develop the students’ ability to comprehend and&nbsp;**connect**&nbsp;with the world around.

To boost the students’&nbsp;**confidence**&nbsp;and instill self-control and discipline, ELDDS offers a safe platform where the students can practice, perform, inspire and fuel their overall development. This ensures the moulding of committed and responsible students who are ready to take on real life situations.
