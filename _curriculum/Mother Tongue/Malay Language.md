<h5><i>RAKAN BAHASA</i></h5><i>

<p align="justify">The school has appointed two students, Nur Raudah Bte Hanapi from P5B and Shaistah Nadia from 5D as the school’s Rakan Bahasa in 2021. The appointment ceremony was held on 9th April 2021. During this ceremony, they were presented with certificates of appointment. Our rakan bahasa is responsible for cultivating and spreading the love for reading amongst students in the school.</p>

<p align="justify">As part of their training, our two ambassadors attended A Newsmaker Session organised by NLB. They then participated in the Newsmaker Competition in which they had to write a script and act out a scene based on a Malay Legend or Folklore. They decided on ‘Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup’, which tells the story of a mother, who was so disappointed that the son finished up all the food, leaving her none. Out of disappointment, she went to a cave and eventually got swallowed by the cave.</p>

<b>HARI RAYA CELEBRATION</b>

<p align="justify">The Hari Raya Celebration at Park View Primary School this year took a different spin as the celebration was done via ZOOM. The celebration started with a quiz on Hari Raya featuring our two non-Muslim teachers to test their knowledge on Hari Raya. This was followed by another video by our P5 students, Haziq Rayyan, Nur Raudha &amp; Shaistah Nadia sharing about Hari Raya. The celebration ended with a dance featuring our wonderful teachers and school leaders!</p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>
<b>ORAL SELF-ASSESSMENT PACKAGE:</b>

<p align="justify">This year, our teachers developed an oral package for our students to develop them into effective communicators. The oral package is interactive and teaches students how to assess themselves for the reading and speaking components. Students will be able to hear examples of reading and speaking which will be accompanied by a discussion and the band achieved by the student. Using this as a guide, students will be able to assess their performance. They will also be able to identify their target band and continue to work towards reaching it. This package hopes to develop students to become competent speakers of the language. This package was rolled out in Term 4 this year and will undergo further refinements for 2022.</p>
