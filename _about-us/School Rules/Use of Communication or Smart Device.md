<p>Students are discouraged from bringing communication devices (such as
mobile phones or smart watches with communication functions) to school
as they can be a major distraction.</p>
<p>If there are strong reasons for a student to bring a communication device
to school, the following rules and regulations must be adhered to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mobile phones and smart devices must be switched off and be kept out of
sight during school hours including recess, CCA and after-school programmes
(e.g.&nbsp; supplementary / enrichment / remedial lessons).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of communication device is strictly for communication purposes
only in the school canteen and main gate after school hours. Video or audio
recording and photography are not allowed within the school compound at
all times.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who use their communication devices inappropriately will have
their devices confiscated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are responsible for the safekeeping of their own communication
devices. The school will not be responsible for any loss or damage.</p>
