### PVPS Aesthetics Framework

![](/images/Aesthetics%20Framework.jpg)

The Aesthetics programme in PVPS is designed in alignment with the Arts Framework. It aims to develop our students in the Cognitive (Knowledge), Affective (Attitude) and Psychomotor (Skills) domains. Through our 4**E** (**Exposure, Expression, Excursion, Excellence**) approach, we aim to develop and harness the full range of our students' talents and contribute to their overall development. With a strong emphasis on 21st century competencies, our programme seeks not only to develop future arts practitioners and audiences imbued with a sense of aesthetics, but also individuals who are civic-minded, cultivated, gracious and able to express themselves through various art forms. Through the arts, we expose our students to local and global cultures, enabling them to gain a better understanding of the world and bridge the gap between cultures. It is a powerful tool that can improve communication and relationships between cultures. They will also have a keen sense of the Singaporean identity and a spirit of experimentation and innovation.

### Experience Programmes

Students learn best through hands-on participation in various performing arts. Through our modular music and dance activities, students are equipped with a sense of musicality, psychomotor skills, instrumental techniques and skills.

**_Music Modular Programmes_**  
  
**_P1 – 4 Game based Activities_**    
Students learn music concepts while having fun! As students’ participation and motivation increase, they create positive experiences which lead to better learning retention.

**_P3 and 4 Ukulele_**  
The ukulele has become increasingly popular in recent times because of its size and its unique sound. It is easier to learn and serves as a good stepping stone for students to learn the guitar at P5. As part of our broad-based arts approach, this programme is aimed at introducing students to the ukulele instrument. The module will give them a better understanding of the anatomy of the ukulele, the various chord progressions and using the instrument to express themselves through music. Through this module, we will build our students’ foundation in rhythm and their aural abilities.
