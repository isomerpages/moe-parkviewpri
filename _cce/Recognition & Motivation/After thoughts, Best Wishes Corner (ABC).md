In order to promote a culture of appreciation and gain deeper reflections about school programmes and events, the ABC (**A**fter thoughts, **B**est wishes **C**orner) was conceptualized. Teachers and pupils tap on their creativity in designing cards to express their best wishes or show their appreciation. It is also used for pupils to pen down their reflections after different school based programmes/ events to promote better learning. The sharings promoted camaraderie and a greater sense of belonging amongst pupils as they learn more about their schoolmates’ thoughts and feelings about school, its people and programmes.
