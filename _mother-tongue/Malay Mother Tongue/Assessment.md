<h4><strong><u>ORAL SELF-ASSESSMENT PACKAGE</u>:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>This year, our teachers developed an oral package for our students to develop them into effective communicators. The oral package is interactive and teaches students how to assess themselves for the reading and speaking components. Students will be able to hear examples of reading and speaking which will be accompanied by a discussion and the band achieved by the student. Using this as a guide, students will be able to assess their performance. They will also be able to identify their target band and continue to work towards reaching it. This package hopes to develop students to become competent speakers of the language. This package was rolled out in Term 4 this year and will undergo further refinements for 2022.</strong>

<p><strong><u>COLLABORATION WITH ETD</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance and hone our skills in using ICT in delivering our lessons,
the ML department collaborated with ETD (apa eh) for one term.</p>
<p>During these sessions our teachers embarked on a project to help our students
write better compositions. The use of ICT was incorporated in the lessons
to provide a tool and opportunity for our teachers as well as students
to develop to learn better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our students learnt to develop their content in their composition through
descriptive writing in characterisation. The ICT tools such as SLS and
padlet create a more interesting learning environment and enhanced on our
students creativity and ability to write better.&nbsp;</p>
