<p>The Primary 6 Motivation Programme is a series of compact workshops spread across Terms 1 to 3. It is aimed to support our primary six pupils by providing them with the requisite skills and mental resilience training so that they can be better motivated and equipped to handle the stresses of being a PSLE candidate.</p><p><strong>Programme Framework:</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Timeline<br></strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Key Focus<br></strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Activities<br></strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Rationale<br></strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" colspan="1"><p>Term 1</p></td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p><em>Goal Setting &amp; Self Discovery</em></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mass Lecture on Hierarchy of Needs &amp; Different Learner Types</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• Understanding own needs<br>• Knowing what is your learning style</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Paper Cutting</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• Understanding that everyone is unique with different learning styles<br>• Working as a team to help each other improve</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Focusing Your Attention &amp; Understanding Your Own Motivation</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vision Board Making &amp; “Hugging”</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• Setting Goals &amp; Vision for year ahead<br>• Understanding the purpose for these goals</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Term 2</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Exam skills &amp; Time Management</p></td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>Integrated with CCE Dept P6 Lifeskills Package<br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• Revising exam skills and time management in exams</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Beginning of Term 3</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Dealing with Stress</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• Knowing the importance of stress management<br>• Learning methods to reduce and manage stress</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mid-Term 3</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Motivation &amp; Resilience Using Positive Thoughts</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Alumni/ Guest talk</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• Inspiring oneself from the example of others<br>• Sharing of personal stories from someone relatable</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>End Term 3</p></td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>Self-Reflection</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Circle Time sharing</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• Reflecting on what has been learnt and gaining strength and support through mutual sharing of feelings &amp; thoughts.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Re-visitation of Vision Board</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• Re-affirming Vision &amp; Goals before PSLE.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Paper Cutting &amp; Vision Board Making:</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/P6%20Motivation.png"></div><p></p>
