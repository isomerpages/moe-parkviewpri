<p align="justify"><b>The online version of the homework boards serves as an additional channel for parents’ reference.<br>
In cases where students may have forgotten to take down the homework assigned to them, the online version allows parents to help themselves to the information through this platform.<br>
Pupils are still expected to exercise personal responsibility in taking down their homework assignments in their Pupil’s Handbook in class.<br>
Parents are expected to check your child’s Handbook daily to monitor the homework assignments and take pro-active steps in building up the discipline of your child towards taking personal responsibility.</b></p>
The Homework Board will be updated between <u>4pm ~ 6pm</u> daily. <br>
PVPS Homework Boards are by the week (Monday to Friday).
