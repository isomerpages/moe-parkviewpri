<p>Since the establishment of the PVPS Alumni in 2011, members have been
assisting with various school events. With our mission to instill a sense
of belonging in graduates so they can contribute back to the school, the
Alumni Exco continues to be the bridge that connects ex-students to Park
View Primary, our alma mater.</p>

most importantly, you keep the PVPS spirit alive. To foster mutual respect
and a sense of community within the alumni family and PVPS, the Alumni
EXCO has developed the following Code of Conduct to set its tone, image
and direction.
