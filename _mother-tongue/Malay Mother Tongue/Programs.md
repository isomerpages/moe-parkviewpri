As part of their training, our two ambassadors attended A Newsmaker Session organised by NLB. They then participated in the Newsmaker Competition in which they had to write a script and act out a scene based on a Malay Legend or Folklore. They decided on ‘Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup’, which tells the story of a mother, who was so disappointed that the son finished up all the food, leaving her none. Out of disappointment, she went to a cave and eventually got swallowed by the cave.
