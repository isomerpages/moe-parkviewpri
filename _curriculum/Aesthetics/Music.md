<b><p>To foster greater appreciation for the arts, students are introduced to different forms of arts through programmes like assembly performances and talks.</p></b>

<h4><i>PVPS Got Talent</i></h4>

<p>PVPS Got Talent aims to provide talented students a platform to showcase their talents. It also aims to cultivate audience and performer etiquette in the audience and performers respectively. Through the programme, we have identified selected students to take part in external music competitions.</p>

<h4>Experience</h4>

<p>Students learn best through hands-on participation in various performing arts. Through our modular music and dance activities, students are equipped with a sense of musicality, psychomotor skills, instrumental techniques and skills.</p>

<h4><u>Music Modular Programmes</u></h4>

<h4><i>P3 and P4 Ukulele</i></h4>

<p>The ukulele has become increasingly popular in recent times because of its size and its unique sound. It is easier to learn and serves as a good stepping stone for students to learn the guitar at P5. As part of our broad-based arts approach, this programme is aimed at introducing students to the ukulele instrument. The module will give them a better understanding of the anatomy of the ukulele, the various chord progressions and using the instrument to express themselves through music. Through this module, we will build our students’ foundation in rhythm and their aural abilities.</p>
