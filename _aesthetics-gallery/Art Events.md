### Beijing-Singapore DoodlePal Exchange Programme – 2016

In commemoration of International Friendship Day, Park View Primary School once again partnered Zhongguancun Number 4 School in Beijing, in Arts activities which included doodling and postcard exchange. Through this partnership, we aim to:

*   strengthen the friendship between the two schools
*   provide opportunities for students to appreciate cultural diversity and foster a willingness to embrace others from diverse background
*   provide a platform for students from both countries to form friendships through Art and postcard exchange

Primary 4 students created artworks based on the theme “Local Delicacies （当地美食）and Places of Interest（ 新加坡名胜地）while Primary 5 students wrote on specially designed postcards based on similar themes. Both schools exchanged artworks, postcards and students’ profiles, in which our students shared about their hobbies and recommended their favourite places of interest in Singapore. Photographs in the form of montages were also shared via the school website and social media platforms. In addition, a wall display was also created to showcase artworks and postcards created by students from both schools to celebrate this significant partnership.

### International Collaboration with Zhongguancun Number 4 Primary | Beijing–Singapore DoodlePAL activity

As part of Park View Primary School’s outreach framework which includes global exchange to develop the 21 CC in our pupils, the school initiated the inaugural Beijing-Singapore DoodlePAL Art activity. We partnered Zhongguancun Number 4 Primary in Beijing, whereby pupils from both countries worked on a squiggle created by the principal and vice-principal from both school respectively.

The objectives of this partnership are to strengthen the understanding and friendship between Zhongguancun No. 4 Primary and Park View Primary, and provide a platform for pupils from both countries to form friendship through art, thereby deepening one’s understanding of the country and their culture.

This DoodlePAL Art activity was carried out in conjunction with the International Friendship Week which began from 6-10 April 2015. All the P3 pupils created artworks based on the theme “International Friendship”.

Both schools exchanged the artworks created and they also completed a profile each to accompany their artworks. This allowed the pupils to get to know their friends from another country. The P3 pupils also wrote on the ‘Post Your Love’ cards for their friends in Beijing. Selected artworks from both countries were also installed in PVPS and Zhongguancun Number 4 Primary to mark the collaboration effort by both countries.

### Arts Fusion Day – NE in Art

#### Arts Fusion Day Overview

The school commemorated our National Day with differentiated art activities. Primary 3 pupils did a ‘uniquely Singapore’ collage, cutting out pictures of heritage sites, landmarks and food that represent Singapore to create a collage whereas the Primary 4 did “Inchies” on the National Day themes. In line with our go green efforts, recycled materials were used in the art pieces. Our Primary 5 created beautiful hanging mobiles on the places of interest in Singapore which are along the MRT lines while our P6s did a story doodle on Singapore history. Through these activities, we hope to instil national pride, the importance and appreciation of our history and also, an outlet for our pupils to release their creativity and express their knowledge.
