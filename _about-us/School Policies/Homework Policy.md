<h4><strong>What is homework?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required to
do by the school outside of curriculum time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homework is an important part of our students’ holistic development in
becoming life-long learners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why is homework a necessity?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Effective use of homework enables students to:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>retain knowledge better ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be more skillful in application of skills and concepts ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen their conceptual understanding ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop good study habits and skills, such as time management, self-evaluation
and self direction ;and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take greater ownership and responsibility for independent learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judicious use of homework allows teachers to:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>consolidate learning that has taken place in class ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check for students’ understanding and progress, so as to provide timely
feedback, intervention and support ; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review effectiveness of lesson.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Homework provides parents with:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>timely information on the learning progress of their children; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunity to be involved in their children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></h4>
<p>1. Level of Difficulty
<br>2. Quality of Homework
<br>3. Amount of Homework/Time Spent
<br>4. Tracking
<br>5. Degree of Flexibility</p>
<h4><strong>1. Level of Difficulty</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Homework should be appropriate to students’ abilities and be within their
developmental readiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As such, there would be differentiated homework given to students of different
abilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>2. Quality of homework</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Homework must be well-thought through and quality in nature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-designed homework should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>be purposeful and encourage critical thinking;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be worth doing and related to class teaching;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be explicit and clearly defined so that students clearly understand what
is required of them; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>involve the use of only material resources that are known to be readily
available to students;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>3. Amount of Homework/ Time Spent</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The specific amount of homework are generally based on student needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quantity of homework assigned take into consideration the following:
<br><strong>a.</strong> Adequate time for family bonding, social activities,
personal interests and rest;
<br><strong>b.</strong> In the classrooms, smart watches can be used only to
tell time during non-assessment or examination period. All smart devices
will be held by the teacher during assessments and examinations.
<br><strong>c. </strong>Coordination of assigning homework;
<br><strong>d. </strong>Differentiation by academic courses or ability level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time spent on homework varies from level to level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is flexibility for EMS teachers to give more than the norm if coordination
is done among the class subject teachers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For non-examinable subjects (HE, SS, etc), subject teachers will give
students at least one week to complete their work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>4. Tracking of homework</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use of homework board - All assignments are written on the board (in the
homework column), specified with the issued and due date.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>5. Degree of Flexibility</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Teachers will set realistic deadline for homework given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If students are not able to complete the homework by the due date due
to good reason, they should inform the teachers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be no fixed day for composition for EL and MT. If composition
homework is given, teachers will not give additional homework for EL/MT.
Students must practice finishing a piece of composition in one sitting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Homework during festive period</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>No homework should be given during festive holidays during term time,
e.g. Chinese New Year, Deepavali and Hari Raya Puasa.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Homework during examination period</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Teachers will be mindful not to overload students with homework and practice
papers in the week before the examinations.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Call parents after three occasions of not submitting/ completing homework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For errant cases, teachers will take necessary actions to get students
to stay behind for detention during recess or after school. Parents will
be duly informed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or extreme cases, teachers to make referrals to the discipline master.</p>
