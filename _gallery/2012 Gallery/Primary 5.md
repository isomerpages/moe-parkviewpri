**P5 - Story: Part 5**

One night, he sent his soldiers to murder the boy who lived on top of a hill. As they marched up the hill, they met a mysterious old woman who discovered their plan. She chanted some magic words and deep red blood started to flow down the hill, causing the terrified soldiers to flee quickly.

The blood eventually caused the soil to turn red and the hill became today's Bukit Merah or Red Hill.
